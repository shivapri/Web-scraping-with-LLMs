At the counter, the shop owner is busy tapping away on a calculator, negotiating prices with a customer from ,.,This is not an ordinary store that sells only to consumers who walk into the shop, but one that ships its products in bulk to overseas retailers. The US is one of the destinations. ""We have about 20 US clients, and we have a relatively close relationship and coordination. There have been no big fluctuations,"" the shop owner surnamed Li told the Global Times.,Following the US' imposition of sweeping tariffs against its trading partners, with extraordinarily high rates against Chinese products, Yiwu, often referred to as the world's capital of small commodities, has drawn great attention,However, contrary to major chaos and disruptions seen in global markets and reported in many places around the world, many businesses in Yiwu, while facing varying degrees of impact, projected calmness and confidence. Where does such confidence come from? In interviews with the Global Times, several local business owners often pointed to their unmatched competitiveness and emphasized their focus on strengthening their competitiveness amid growing external uncertainties.,For businesses in Yiwu, running their own affairs well means staying focused on continuously bolstering their global competitiveness - in terms of the quality of their products and the efficiency of their business strategies. ""First strengthen yourself, then compete,"" as one businessman put it, when asked about Yiwu's response to the US' tariffs. ,""Our products are essential goods. Whether in developed or emerging markets, the demand will not disappear,"" ,, owner of Conan Tools, a hardware shop in Yiwu, told the Global Times. His company has seen some disruptions from the US' tariffs, with outbound shipments suspended following the US' tariffs, but he is not worried. ""The quality we deliver at this price simply can't be matched if produced domestically in the US."",Such quality and cost-effectiveness do not come easily; it requires unwavering focus, according to Wendy, Wang's daughter. ""From raw steel to finished product, I personally follow up on production. I inspect surface treatments, materials, and check for burrs - basic but essential quality indicators. Every type of tool is sourced from specialized factories, and we sign formal procurement contracts specifying material, production details, packaging, and delivery timelines,"" she told the Global Times.,Quality and cost-effectiveness are what have drawn many clients from around the world to Yiwu. ,""We come here twice a year,"" a trader from the , told the Global Times, as he browsed through shelves of locks and hand tools at a store in Yiwu.

""In fact, some brands here now produce even better finishing than European suppliers I used to work with. That's why I've shifted part of my sourcing to Yiwu in the past two years."",Behind the strong competitiveness of Yiwu businesses is the vast, constantly upgrading manufacturing industry in China. ,In the first quarter of 2025, , manufacturing sales revenue increased by 4.8 percent year-on-year, 0.9 percentage points higher than that from 2024, according to official data. Meanwhile, as , manufacturing further upgrades, investment is also expanding, with a 9.1 percent year-on-year increase recorded in the first quarter of 2025, official data showed. ,Taking advantage of such a robust manufacturing base, many businesses in Yiwu have also been working to bolster their adaptability - another key competitive edge of Yiwu businesses - to cope with disruptions caused by the US. ,Lou Haidong, owner of Yiwu Seachain Trade Co, a racing maintenance tool manufacturer where 80 percent of orders come from the US, recalled that in 2018, they faced similar export pressures, with orders to the US being paused for several months.,To overcome the pressure, the company has since established warehouses overseas to lessen the impact of tariffs and mitigate future uncertainties in the US market. Their global footprint has continued to expand ever since.,A staff member at Lou's company told the Global Times that as US policy grows uncertain, new opportunities are arising in , and the ,.

These first results show the promise of TAR-200 in this patient population with more than an 80 percent disease-free survival (DFS) rate without the need for reinduction and 94 percent of patients able to preserve their bladder. The high DFS and bladder preservation rate combined with the well-tolerated safety profile in these patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) with papillary-only disease (high-grade Ta or T1) show the potential of TAR-200 as a meaningful alternative to surgery. These results were featured in the , plenary session at the ,.,""The majority of patients remained free of cancer recurrence during this critical early study period, highlighting the potential of TAR-200 as a highly effective treatment for these patients who may have limited options beyond bladder removal,"" said Félix ,-,*, M.D., PhD, FEBU, Head of Uro-Oncology at Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, , and presenting author. ""As we continue monitoring patients through the 12-month mark and beyond, our focus remains on assessing TAR-200's long-term efficacy in maintaining disease-free survival and improving outcomes for this high-risk patient population."",""Surgical removal of the bladder has long been the standard of care for patients suffering from BCG-unresponsive HR-NMIBC with papillary-only disease, a life-altering procedure that drastically impacts a patient's quality of life,"" said ,, M.D., Vice President, Disease Area Leader, Bladder Cancer, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. ""These results demonstrate that TAR-200 can be a meaningful alternative to surgery that is both effective and well-tolerated while preserving the bladder."",First results of this interim analysis from Cohort 4 of the SunRISe-1 study demonstrated 85.3 percent and 81.1 percent DFS rates at six and nine months, respectively, in patients with BCG-unresponsive, HR-NMIBC with papillary-only disease treated with TAR-200 monotherapy. These high DFS rates are particularly encouraging given the significant risk of recurrence in this population., Among patients with high-grade Ta and T1 disease, DFS rates remained consistently strong—85.7 percent and 84.7 percent at six months, and 82.1 percent and 79.4 percent at nine months, respectively. The strong DFS across both subtypes—despite their differing depths of invasion—underscores the potential of TAR-200 to deliver sustained tissue penetration. Notably, 94.2 percent of patients avoided radical cystectomy at median follow-up of 12.8 months. The early progression-free and overall survival rates of 95.6 percent and 98 percent at nine months, respectively, are reassuring as disease progression or death were highly uncommon among patients treated with TAR-200., While 12-month DFS data is not yet mature, these preliminary findings show that TAR-200's sustained intravesical gemcitabine delivery may potentially offer durable disease control while minimizing the need for invasive procedures. These results support continued evaluation in the ongoing Phase 3 SunRISe-5 study (,), comparing TAR-200 to chemotherapy in patients with BCG-pretreated, papillary-only HR-NMIBC.,Among the 52 patients enrolled, the safety profile of TAR-200 monotherapy was consistent with prior studies, with no new safety signals observed. Most treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were low grade and resolved quickly, with a median duration of 3.7 weeks. Common TRAEs included dysuria (40.4 percent), pollakiuria (30.8 percent), and urgency (26.9 percent). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 13.5 percent of patients, most frequently bladder pain (3.8 percent). Three patients (5.8 percent) experienced serious TRAEs, and only four (7.7 percent) discontinued treatment due to TRAEs. No treatment-related deaths were reported., ,Bladder cancer ranks among the top ten most common cancers worldwide, affecting nearly a million people each year., Despite advancements, the standard of care has remained largely unchanged for over 40 years, leaving patients with limited treatment options if initial BCG therapy does not work., TAR-200 delivers sustained medication directly into the bladder, offering a fresh approach to treat early-stage bladder cancer.,TAR-200 is inserted directly into the bladder by a healthcare professional in a brief outpatient procedure, without the need for anesthesia. Designed to remain in the bladder, it does not interfere with daily activities and provides sustained release of treatment throughout the day. To date, TAR-200 has been placed more than 10,000 times as part of the SunRISe clinical program.,TAR-200 is an investigational intravesical gemcitabine releasing system. In ,, Johnson & Johnson announced the initiation of a , with the FDA for TAR-200 under the real-time oncology review (RTOR) program. In ,, the FDA , Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) to TAR-200 for the treatment of adult patients with BCG-unresponsive HR-NMIBC with CIS who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo radical cystectomy. The safety and efficacy of TAR-200 are being evaluated in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in patients with MIBC in  ,, and NMIBC in ,, , and ,.,SunRISe-1 (,) is an ongoing Phase ,, randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of TAR-200, an intravesical gemcitabine releasing system, in patients with BCG-unresponsive HR-NMIBC who are ineligible for, or elected not to undergo, radical cystectomy. Cohort 4 specifically enrolls patients with papillary-only disease, treating them with TAR-200 monotherapy. The primary end-point of Cohort 4 is disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 12 months. Key secondary end points included safety and tolerability.,High-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is a type of non-invasive bladder cancer that is more likely to recur or spread beyond the lining of the bladder, called the urothelium, and progress to muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to low-risk NMIBC., HR-NMIBC makes up 15-44 percent of patients with NMIBC and is characterized by a high-grade, large tumor size, presence of multiple tumors, and CIS., Radical cystectomy is currently recommended for NMIBC patients who fail BCG therapy, with over 90 percent cancer-specific survival if performed before muscle-invasive progression., Given that NMIBC typically affects older patients, many may be unwilling or unfit to undergo radical cystectomy., The high rates of recurrence and progression can pose significant morbidity and distress for these patients.,At Johnson & Johnson, we believe health is everything. Our strength in healthcare innovation empowers us to build a world where complex diseases are prevented, treated, and cured, where treatments are smarter and less invasive, and solutions are personal.

The findings demonstrate the highest complete response rate without reinduction with more than half of responders remaining cancer-free for at least 12 months. These results highlight the potential of TAR-200 as a breakthrough for people with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS), with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible or refuse radical cystectomy (RC). These results were featured in the , plenary session at the ,.,""Treatment with TAR-200 has long-lasting effectiveness. More than 82 percent of patients achieved a complete response, and of those that initially responded to treatment, more than half showed no signs of cancer at one year,"" said ,*, M.D., MCR, Associate Professor of Urology at Upstate Medical University and presenting author. ""These findings represent the highest complete response rate observed for patients with HR-NMIBC and underscore the potential of TAR-200 to provide long-lasting cancer control for patients."",""Bladder cancer is one of the ten most common cancers worldwide, yet treatment options have remained largely unchanged for over 40 years, leaving patients with few choices if initial BCG therapy does not work,"" said ,, M.D., Vice President, Disease Area Leader, Bladder Cancer, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. ""TAR-200 is designed to allow for sustained delivery of medication directly into the bladder through a brief and routine procedure, which benefits patients. These data now show patients can remain cancer-free for a meaningful period of time, marking a significant step forward for those facing this challenging disease."",As of ,, 82.4 percent of the 85 enrolled patients in the study achieved a complete response (CR) (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 72.6-89.8), meaning their cancer was undetectable following treatment. This high response rate translated into sustained disease control, with 52.9 percent of responders maintaining complete response at one year. The median duration of response (DOR) was 25.8 months (95 percent CI, 8.3-not estimable), indicating that many patients remained cancer-free for over two years without the need for reinduction therapy. At 12 months, 86.6 percent (95 percent CI, 76.6-92.6) of responders remained cystectomy-free. Importantly, the treatment was well-tolerated, with most adverse events being mild urinary symptoms. These findings show that TAR-200 offers a highly effective and durable treatment option for patients with certain types of BCG-unresponsive HR-NMIBC.,Most treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were mild and manageable. Overall, 71 patients (83.5 percent) experienced TRAEs, the majority of which were low-grade urinary symptoms, such as bladder irritation or discomfort. Eleven patients (12.9 percent) experienced Grade 3 or higher TRAEs, and five patients (5.9 percent) reported serious TRAEs. Only three patients (3.5 percent) discontinued treatment due to TRAEs, and there were no treatment-related deaths.,TAR-200 is inserted directly into the bladder by a healthcare professional in a brief outpatient procedure, without the need for anesthesia. Designed to remain in the bladder, it does not interfere with daily activities and provides sustained release of treatment throughout the day. To date, TAR-200 has been placed more than 10,000 times as part of the SunRISe clinical program.,Earlier results from Cohort 2 were previously presented at the , and at the ,.

Cohort 2 specifically enrolls patients with carcinoma in situ, with or without papillary disease, treating them with TAR-200 monotherapy. The primary endpoint for Cohort 2 is CR rate at any time point. Secondary endpoints include duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), pharmacokinetics, quality of life, safety and tolerability.,High-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is a type of non-invasive bladder cancer that is more likely to recur or spread beyond the lining of the bladder, called the urothelium, and progress to muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to low-risk NMIBC., HR-NMIBC makes up 15-44 percent of patients with NMIBC and is characterized by a high-grade, large tumor size, presence of multiple tumors, and CIS., Radical cystectomy is currently recommended for NMIBC patients who fail BCG therapy, with over 90 percent cancer-specific survival if performed before muscle-invasive progression., Given that NMIBC typically affects older patients, many may be unwilling or unfit to undergo radical cystectomy.,At Johnson & Johnson, we believe health is everything.

However, the clinical application of TCE continues to be greatly hindered by the unfavorable pharmacokinetics and toxicity associated with cytokine release syndrome. To overcome these limitations, Antengene developed ATG-201, a ""2+1"" CD19 x CD3 TCE, which was evaluated in a series of , studies for binding affinity, T cell dependent cytotoxicity (TDCC) cytokine release, and drug developability. The , anti-lymphoma efficacy and pharmacodynamic effect were evaluated in Raji xenograft model. The tissue resident B cell depletion was assessed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells humanized mice. Pharmacokinetic parameters of ATG-201 were evaluated in normal Balb/c mice.,•   , ATG-201 demonstrated high affinity binding to CD19, limited T cell binding before CD19 crosslinking, highly potent CD19-dependent T cell cytotoxicity against CD19+ B cells, as well as enhanced naïve B cell depletion with reduced cytokine release compared to clinical benchmarks. In lymphoma models, the study observed potent , efficacy with reduced cytokine release. In CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells humanized mice, ATG-201 was able to induce complete B cell depletion with reduced cytokine release. ATG-201 has a mAb-like pharmacokinetic profile in wild type mice and good drug developability. Moreover, surrogate CD19 x CD3 AnTenGager TCE displayed potent efficacy in MRL/lpr spontaneous systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) mouse models and MOG-Induced EAE models.,•   , ATG-201 demonstrated CD19-dependent CD3 binding and activation, inducing effective B cell depletion , and , with low cytokine release, which provides potential for the treatment of B cell malignancies and B cell related autoimmune diseases. ATG-201 is poised to enter clinical development in the second half of 2025.,Preclinical characterization of ATG-042, a novel MTAP,-selective PRMT5 inhibitor,4230,Experimental and Molecular Therapeutics,HDAC and Methyltransferase Inhibitors, ,          ,, , - ,, , (Beijing Time),Poster Section 16, Targeting the PRMT5-MTA complex has become a promising strategy for treating MTAP, cancer in a synthetically lethal manner, avoiding on-target-off-tumor hematological toxicity when using first-generation, non-selective PRMT5 inhibitors. Herein, Antengene developed ATG-042, a novel MTAP,-selective PRMT5 small molecule inhibitor with good brain penetration. In this study, the , activity and MTAP selectivity of ATG-042 were profiled using HCT116 MTAP wild type (wt) cells, HCT116 MTAP knock out (ko) cells and multiple endogenous MTAP, cell lines. The , efficacy was tested in cell derived xenograft (CDX) mouse models with HCT116 MTAP wt cells, HCT116 MTAP ko cells, LU99 cells (MTAP,) and U87MG-luc (MTAP,). The pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties were assessed with corresponding assay methods., ATG-042 showed excellent anti-proliferative activities on multiple endogenous MTAP, cell lines with IC, values between 10nM and 100nM. ATG-042 demonstrated high permeability, good metabolic stability, and low risk of drug-drug interaction. , PK study shows that ATG-042 is well absorbed, with a dose-dependent increase in plasma distribution and high oral bioavailability in mice, SD rats and beagle dogs. Furthermore, ATG-042 is brain-penetrable (B/P ratio=51% in mice; KPuu,=0.73 in rats). ATG-042 showed robust , efficacy in both subcutaneous CDX models (HCT116 -MTAP ko, LU99) and orthotopic CDX model (U87MG-luc) as a single agent. In addition, ATG-042 also exhibited potential synergy in combination with other drugs for antitumor therapy., ATG-042 is an oral MTAP,-selective PRMT5 inhibitor with potent efficacy against MTAP, tumor. It also demonstrated good tolerability and brain penetrability. ATG-042 is poised to enter clinical development in the second half of 2025., ,ATG-110, a novel ""2+1"" LY6G6D-targeted T-cell Engager (TCE) with high potency for the treatment of MSS colorectal cancer,3509,Immunology,T Cell Engagers, , - 5:00 PM (Central Time),          ,, , (Beijing Time),Poster Section 38,•   , Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and requires more effective and safer therapies to improve the poor survival outcome, particularly in patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer, who exhibit primary resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors and lack effective treatment options. T cell engagers have shown encouraging efficacy in treating hematological malignancies, while exhibiting suboptimal clinical efficacies in solid tumors. The risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) remains as a significant challenge clinically. ATG-110 is a novel ""2+1"" LY6G6D x CD3 TCE developed by Antengene. In this study, ATG-110 was evaluated in a series of preclinical , studies for binding affinity, T cell activation and cytokine release, T cell dependent cytotoxicity (TDCC), and drug developability. The , anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated in PBMC-humanized immunodeficient NDG mice engrafted with LY6G6D,-expression HT55 or LY6G6D,-expression SW480 MSS CRC cells.,•   , ATG-110 binds to LY6G6D-positive cell lines, including LY6G6D-overexpression 293T and HT55 with the nanomolar grade EC,. The CD3 binding site of ATG-110 is concealed by the LY6G6D Fab arm before binding to LY6G6D, due to the steric hindrance. Therefore, ATG-110 demonstrated limited binding capability to CD3+ cells before LY6G6D crosslinking. It activates T cells and induces cytokine release only in the presence of LY6G6D+ cells. ,, ATG-110 resulted in potent T cell dependent cytotoxicity with single-digit pM IC, values on HT55 cells. ATG-110 also showed highly potent , efficacy against LY6G6D,-expression cells. ATG-110 exhibited a low risk of inducing cytokine release syndrome. ATG-110 demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in PBMC-humanized HT55 xenograft model. Furthermore, ATG-110 also demonstrated good drug developability.,•   , ATG-110 demonstrated LY6G6D-dependent CD3 binding and activation with low risk of CRS. It showed powerful , and , anti-tumor efficacy against colorectal cancer, which warrants further clinical evaluation.,Development of a diagnostic antibody for CD24 targeted therapy,671,Clinical Research,Diagnostic Biomarkers 2, ,Poster Section 29,•   , CD24 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for anti-cancer treatment. Several clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD24-targeted therapies. Here, Antengene developed and characterized an anti-CD24 diagnostic antibody to enhance the screening and selection of patients based on CD24 expression. In this study, the authors described the discovery of the diagnostic antibody, and the evaluation of accuracy, sensitivity (selectivity), specificity, and assay precision of the antibody.,•   , Monoclonal antibody clone ATG-1144 binds to the hCD24 core peptide in ELISA with an EC, of 0.06 nM. Distinct membrane staining on human normal esophageal tissue FFPE specimens can also be observed with IHC staining using ATG-1144. For accuracy assessment, six CDX and twenty human specimens, comprising both positive and negative specimens (including solid tumors and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas), were validated. Samples exhibiting high, medium, and low CD24 expression levels were evaluated for sensitivity and specificity, and the interpreted results aligned with the reference outcomes. FFPE tissues from three distinct patients were evaluated for assay precision assessment. The TMA IHC staining result revealed that 50-80% of patients with lung, breast, bladder, ovarian, or liver cancer have CD24 expression on tumor cell surface with low expression in the para-cancerous normal tissue.,•   , ATG-1144 specifically binds to human CD24 with high sensitivity as demonstrated by IHC staining. The development and validation of the method have been finalized using , platforms. These data suggest a potential diagnostic use of ATG-1144 for identifying CD24+ patients.,Antengene Corporation Limited (,, SEHK: 6996.HK) is a leading commercial-stage R&D-driven global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization of innovative first-in-class/best-in-class therapeutics for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, in realizing its vision of,.,Antengene has built a pipeline of 9 oncology assets at various stages going from clinical to commercial, including 6 with global rights, and 3 with rights for the APAC region.

              ,Stepping away from their online feeds and into the real world, Jonas and Phillips - who have over 35 million followers between them - were joined by Victoria's Secret models , and ,, Yankees pitcher ,, socialite , and high-profile influencers including , and , at the 'Off Socials' event at Bleecker Street Bar.,In an ironic slant on the digital sphere they dominate, Jonas and Phillips posed in windows decked out to look like Instagram reels to highlight a simple message: the best way to disconnect from the sometimes overwhelming world of social media is to connect in real life.,The event celebrated the launch of a new Heineken, campaign - #SocialOffSocials - following the revelation that half of adults globally (52%) are overwhelmed by the pressure to keep up with social media. In fact, 62% (and 75% of Gen Z) say despite being able to connect with anyone instantly via their phone, they can feel lonely.,In the spirit of going offline, , debuted his new track 'Heart by Heart' at the event - using the world's oldest social network, the bar - ahead of releasing it on digital channels. He also filmed part of the new music video at the event in front of the offline crowd to showcase the power of real-life moments over digital ones.,Heineken, has joined forces with Jonas and the creators in its latest advertising campaign - launching next week - dramatizing how they would react to empty social media feeds if more people were out having a good time IRL.,""It's so easy to fall into the habit of doomscrolling on your phone - I've definitely been there. We live in a world where everyone's glued to their social media feeds, so I'm excited to be part of this Heineken campaign encouraging people to put their phones down and connect in real life. I chose to debut my new song offline and in-person because it felt like the perfect time to return to what music is really about: connecting with people. The crowd was so real, so present, and completely locked into the music - that is something you can't experience by watching on social media."",By teaming up with figures like Jonas and Dude with Sign whose lives are deeply embedded in online culture, Heineken, - which has always championed quality socializing - playfully conveys that stepping away from social media makes for a more rewarding social life.,Studying the screen time of 17,000 adults worldwide*, Heineken, uncovered that the average person now spends approximately 5 hours and 48 minutes per day looking at their device. That equates to a massive 127,020 minutes a year - a full 88 days.,The global report into scrolling and socializing habits found that three in five people (59%) across all age-groups say that the amount of time they spend on their phone has increased in the past year. Additional analysis by global research company Statista found that time spent socializing IRL has decreased by 35% over the past 24 years, whereas since the introduction of mobile based social media platforms such as Instagram (2010) and Snapchat (2011), the time we've spent scrolling has more than doubled (+54%)**.,Now, nearly half of all adults (47%) would describe themselves as 'always online' according to the Heineken, report and that the stream of notifications they receive is ""constant"" (60%). As a result, half (51%) agree that their social battery can feel drained by the amount of time they spend speaking to people online - rising to almost two-thirds (62%) among Gen Z.,However, an overwhelming 79% agreed that when they are out socializing they look at their phone less, proving that disconnecting from social media is easier when you are engaging in a more refreshing social life. Two thirds (64%) of people said they wish they could go back to a time when people socialized without smartphones., ""At Heineken,, we've always believed that the best connections are created in real life. I'm a big fan and participant on social media, but it's also important to take a break and experience things IRL too. This campaign is a gentle reminder that stepping away from our screens can lead to more refreshing and meaningful social experiences, and help us feel less overwhelmed by the constant notifications on our phones. Working with creators - who are by their nature always online - to highlight the solution may seem ironic, but they too realize it's about balance and were as eager as us to encourage IRL socializing. So many people feel overwhelmed by the pressure of constant online engagement, so we want to show how easy it can be to take a break from social media."",When you get social, you get off your socials.

The lead, built on the highly reliable SelectSecure™ Model 3830 pacing lead and delivered via catheter, builds on the Medtronic portfolio of lead solutions designed for precise delivery and placement. The lead connects to an implantable defibrillator, and treats potentially life threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) and bradyarrhythmias. As the world's smallest defibrillation lead (4.7 French, or 1.6mm), the OmniaSecure lead represents a meaningful innovation in electrophysiology, and is indicated for stimulation in the right ventricle for adults and adolescent pediatric patients ages 12 and up, including those with smaller anatomies.,
              ,Separately, the company is also studying placing the novel, small-diameter OmniaSecure defibrillation lead in the left bundle branch (LBB) area, which has the potential to enable physiologic pacing to more closely mimic the heart's natural conduction system. Investigational outcomes of this study were presented at Heart Rhythm 2025 in ,. The results from the study demonstrate high defibrillation success of 100% at implant when the lead is implanted in the LBB area. Globally, the OmniaSecure defibrillation lead is investigational for use in LBB area and requires FDA approval in the future.,Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRT-Ds) are the standard for preventing sudden cardiac death. The ICD/CRT-D connects to a defibrillation lead (insulated electrical wire) that forms the electrical conduit between the device and the heart. The lead senses the heartbeat, and transmits signals to the implanted device, which then delivers therapy to correct or interrupt abnormally fast rhythms. The lead must flex with millions of heart contractions over a lifetime.,Existing defibrillation leads are larger in diameter than the OmniaSecure lead. A larger-diameter lead may increase the potential for downstream complications, such as venous occlusion or tricuspid valve regurgitation.,""FDA approval for the OmniaSecure defibrillation lead furthers our ability to offer physicians and patients a transvenous solution designed to be smaller to help minimize complications−including vascular complications and valve interaction−with strong, reliable lead durability. We engineered the OmniaSecure lead based on the trusted SelectSecure Model 3830 pacing lead, which has been the lead of choice for many physicians for more than 20 years,"" said ,, M.D., chief medical officer of the Cardiac Rhythm Management business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""This milestone underscores our commitment to driving clinical innovations that help patients today while paving the way for future innovations that will usher in the next era of electrophysiology."",Previously, researchers presented late breaking data from the global Lead Evaluation for Defibrillation and Reliability (LEADR) Pivotal Trial showing the OmniaSecure defibrillation lead met its primary safety and effectiveness endpoints and exceeded prespecified performance goals when placed within the right ventricle. The results were presented during Heart Rhythm 2024, simultaneously published in ,, and are the basis of FDA approval for the traditional right ventricular lead placement indication.,Researchers presented late-breaking results at Heart Rhythm 2025 for the LEADR LBBAP (Lead Evaluation for Defibrillation and Reliability in Left Bundle Branch Area Pacing) study that showed the OmniaSecure defibrillation lead demonstrated high defibrillation success when placed in the LBB area for patients indicated for an ICD or CRT-D. Placing the defibrillation lead in the LBB area is being evaluated as an alternative to right ventricular stimulation for sensing, pacing, cardioversion and defibrillation.,Defibrillation testing conducted in 162 patients at device implantation was successful in 100% of cases, with the study meeting the prespecified efficacy goal of 88%. Of the first 193 patients implanted in the study, the OmniaSecure lead was successfully implanted per protocol in 95.8% of the procedures as reported by physician investigators. There were no procedure-related major complications such as early helix or lead fracture, system revision, or death.,""The left bundle branch area is emerging as an option for more physiologic pacing for patients who receive an ICD or CRT-D to treat dangerous heart rhythms,"" said Pugazhendhi Vijayaraman, M.D., cardiac electrophysiologist at Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center in ,, who presented the data at the meeting. ""The option to place a lead in the left bundle branch area may provide for physiologic pacing by engaging the heart's natural conduction system. These positive preliminary results for the LEADR LBBAP study are encouraging and highlight the potential versatility of the OmniaSecure defibrillation lead."",The LEADR LBBAP trial is a global, prospective, non-randomized, multi-center study. The study has enrolled approximately 300 patients at 24 sites in 11 countries in ,, ,, , and ,. Patients enrolled in the study indicated for an ICD are being followed out to 3 months while patients indicated for CRT-D are being followed out to 6 months post-implant., ,Bold thinking.

Federal banking regulations implementing the international regulatory capital framework, referred to as the ""Basel III Rules,"" apply to both depository institutions and (subject to certain exceptions not applicable to the Company) their holding companies. The Basel III Rules also establish a ""capital conservation buffer"" of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. The Basel III minimum capital ratios with the full capital conservation buffer are summarized in the table below.,On ,, the federal banking agencies jointly finalized a rule intended to simplify the Basel III regulatory capital requirements described above for qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (""CBLR"") framework, as required by Section 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. The final rule became effective on ,, and the CBLR framework became available for banks to use beginning with their , Call Reports. Under the final rule, if a qualifying community banking organization opts into the CBLR framework and meets all requirements under the framework, it will be considered to have met the ""well-capitalized"" regulatory capital ratio requirements under the ""prompt corrective action"" regulations promulgated by the federal banking agencies and will not be required to report or calculate risk-based capital under the Basel III Rules. In order to qualify for the CBLR framework, a community banking organization must have a tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9.0%, less than , in total consolidated assets, and limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities.,The Company and the Bank are qualifying community banking organizations and, on ,, the Company and the Bank elected to opt into the CBLR framework. However, the Company currently operates under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ""Federal Reserve"") and, therefore, is not currently subject to the Federal Reserve's consolidated capital reporting requirements. Accordingly, the Company's election to opt into the CBLR framework will commence for the first reporting period for which the Company no longer operates under the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, at which time the Company will become subject to the Federal Reserve's consolidated capital requirements. ,By electing to opt into the CBLR framework, the Company and the Bank are not required to report or calculate risk-based capital under the Basel III Rules described above. As of ,, the Bank's bank-only CBLR amounted to 10.80%.

The data, unveiled as a late breaking presentation at the 2025 Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) annual meeting, demonstrated the potential for both high acute effectiveness, and a promising safety profile: 100% acute PVI with durable isolation in 84.5% of pulmonary veins at 3-month remapping and a 3.0% primary adverse event rate, with only 0.7% being potentially catheter related., The data has been simultaneously published in ,.,Omny-IRE is a 12-month prospective, multi-center, non-randomized clinical trial that evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the OMNYPULSE™ Platform for the mapping and treatment of symptomatic PAF during standard ablation procedures., The OMNYPULSE™ Platform consists of the OMNYPULSE™ Catheter, a novel focal pulsed field ablation (PFA) catheter, and the TRUPULSE™ Generator, and is fully integrated with the CARTO™ 3 System. The OMNYPULSE™ Catheter is the first large-tip, 12 mm focal catheter with contact force sensing and a TRUEref™ reference electrode to reduce the impact of far-field unipolar signals. The TRUPULSE™ Generator provides a bipolar, biphasic pulse application to the catheter's twelve electrodes. With the CARTO™ 3 System software used in the study, clinicians were able to obtain a Pulsed Field (PF) Index value for each ablation, which is a calculation using the real-time contact force feedback combined with the number of pulsed field applications., As an integrated platform, OMNYPULSE™ brings together mapping precision, energy delivery, and real-time feedback into a single ecosystem—streamlining workflows and helping electrophysiologists deliver more consistent outcomes.,""The 3-month data provide encouraging early evidence of the OMNYPULSE™ Platform,"" said ,., Ph.D., Department of Cardiology, Electrophysiology Section, AZ Sint-Jan Hospital, Brugge, ,., ""What's most compelling is the combination of 100% acute and strong remap success, with a low rate of safety events. These results reinforce the potential of OMNYPULSE and its integration with the CARTO™ 3 System to deliver reproducible, durable outcomes for patients with paroxysmal AFib."",In addition, data from the VARIPURE study are being shared at the HRS Annual Meeting, evaluating the real-world safety and operator learning curve associated with the use of the VARIPULSE™ Platform PVI procedures for atrial fibrillation. Conducted across 13 European sites, the prospective, post-market study included 247 patients and 40 operators with varying levels of experience, including first-time users. Notably, no serious adverse events were reported, and no complications were linked to the platform, including zero neurovascular events or coronary spasms. Among a subset of 115 patients treated by operators performing their first 10 VARIPULSE™ cases, results showed no measurable learning curve beyond a modest reduction in idle time between ablations, underscoring the efficiency and ease of adopting this innovative technology., VARIPURE is an ongoing registry, with over 600 patients enrolled to date.  ,""The VARIPULSE™ Platform has both a strong safety profile and is highly accessible to new users, enabling safe and consistent outcomes from the very first case. As adoption of PFA expands, I believe VARIPULSE™ can play a key role in broadening access to safe and streamlined ablation procedures,"" said Francis Bessière M.D., Ph.D., Cardiac Electrophysiology Department, Hôpital Cardiologique Louis Pradel, Hospices Civils de ,.,Additional data presented at HRS by Dr. , include new preclinical validation of a PF Index from the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH™ SF Catheter, leveraging data from lesions created in a swine beating heart model. The analysis confirmed that lesion depth, which is crucial for effective treatment, correlates strongly with the number of PFA pulses and contact force using a logarithmic PF Index—accurately predicting lesion depth within ±1 mm in 92% of cases and ±1.5 mm in all cases. These findings reinforce the reliability of the pulse dosing protocol and underline the PF Index's value as a practical tool for guiding ablation. The index is specifically optimized to support durable lesion formation, offering physicians confidence in its outputs and enabling them to make informed, real-time decisions with a high degree of procedural predictability and clinical precision.,These multiplatform findings advance the clinical and technical validation of Johnson & Johnson MedTech's PFA portfolio across focal, regional and dual energy catheter designs—each leveraging CARTO™ 3 System integration and real-time lesion feedback. These latest data are part of Johnson & Johnson MedTech's commitment to advancing understanding of PFA, including the recently , 12-month results from the SmartfIRE clinical trial presented in ,.,""Our PFA portfolio is built around what matters most to physicians—durability, control, safety and efficiency,"" said ,, Ph.D., Vice President, Scientific Affairs, Johnson & Johnson MedTech.

The changes are set forth below and are anticipated to go into effect after markets open on ,.,For more information on RDTE please visit: ,.,Founded in 2018, Roundhill Investments is an SEC-registered investment advisor focused on innovative exchange-traded funds. Roundhill's suite of ETFs offers distinct and differentiated exposures across thematic equity, options income, and trading vehicles. Roundhill offers a depth of ETF knowledge and experience, as the team has collectively launched more than 100+ ETFs including several first-to-market products. To learn more about the company, please visit roundhillinvestments.com.,A covered call strategy involves writing (selling) covered call options in return for the receipt of premiums. The seller of the option gives up the opportunity to benefit from price increases in the underlying instrument above the exercise price of the options, but continues to bear the risk of underlying instrument price declines. The premiums received from the options may not be sufficient to offset any losses sustained from underlying instrument price declines. Exchanges may suspend the trading of options during periods of abnormal market volatility. Suspension of trading may mean that an option seller is unable to sell options at a time that may be desirable or advantageous to do so.,Additionally, the Fund is a ""synthetic"" covered call strategy, meaning that it derives its long exposure to the Small Cap Index from options that utilize the Small Cap Index as the reference asset. This synthetic exposure increases the likelihood that the Fund's returns may not always precisely align with the returns of the Small Cap Index.,The use of options involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions and depends on the ability of the Fund's portfolio managers to forecast market movements correctly. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, or in interest or currency exchange rates, including the anticipated volatility, which in turn are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political and economic events. The effective use of options also depends on the Fund's ability to terminate option positions at times deemed desirable to do so. There is no assurance that the Fund will be able to effect closing transactions at any particular time or at an acceptable price. In addition, there may at times be an imperfect correlation between the movement in values of options and their underlying securities and there may at times not be a liquid secondary market for certain options. Lastly, the trading of options is subject to transaction costs that may impact the Fund's returns., Trading FLEX Options involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities. The Fund may experience losses from specific FLEX Option positions and certain FLEX Option positions may expire worthless. The FLEX Options are listed on an exchange; however, no one can guarantee that a liquid secondary trading market will exist for the FLEX Options.,The Fund's use of zero days to expiration, known as ""0DTE"" options, presents additional risks. Due to the short time until their expiration, 0DTE options are more sensitive to sudden price movements and market volatility than options with more time until expiration. Because of this, the timing of trades utilizing 0DTE options becomes more critical. Although the Fund intends to enter into 0DTE options trades on market open, or shortly thereafter, even a slight delay in the execution of these trades can significantly impact the outcome of the trade. Such options may also suffer from low liquidity, making it more difficult for the Fund to enter into its positions each morning at desired prices. The bid-ask spreads on 0DTE options can be wider than with traditional options, increasing the Fund's transaction costs and negatively affecting its returns. Additionally, the proliferation of 0DTE options is relatively new and may therefore be subject to rule changes and operational frictions. To the extent that the OCC enacts new rules relating to 0DTE options that make it impractical or impossible for the Fund to utilize 0DTE options to effectuate its investment strategy, it may instead utilize options with the shortest remaining maturity available or it may utilize swap agreements to provide the desired exposure.,The fund is new and has a limited operating history.,The use of derivative instruments (i.e. options contracts) involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.,The Fund currently expects to make distributions on a weekly basis. These distributions may exceed the Fund's income and gains for the Fund's taxable year. Distributions in excess of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a return of capital.,The Fund will have significant exposure to the Small Cap Index through its investments in options that utilize the Small Cap Index as the reference asset.,Small and/or mid capitalization companies may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments, and their securities may be less liquid and may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies as a result of several factors, including limited trading volumes, fewer products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information. Accordingly, such companies are generally subject to greater market risk than larger, more established companies.,Roundhill Financial Inc. serves as the investment advisor.

This growth was partially offset by the decrease in enterprise value loans of ,, or 15.3%.,Mr. Reilly noted ""The Bank has been successful in expanding our loan portfolio in the areas targeted for growth and reducing exposures in the enterprise value portfolio, rapidly shifting our mix from this riskier segment to traditional in-market commercial and commercial real estate.

We are actively engaging with the borrower to mitigate the impact of this troubled credit and determine the most effective path to preserving the Bank's interest and reach a mutually agreeable resolution.

Reports 1st Quarter Earnings,"April 27, 2025","Apr 25, 2025, 15:03 ET",", , /PRNewswire/ -- Ohio Valley Banc Corp. [Nasdaq: ,] (the ""Company"") reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended ,, of ,, an increase of ,, or 57.8%, from the same period the prior year. Earnings per share for the first quarter of 2025 were ,, compared to , for the first quarter of 2024. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.20% and 11.82%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2025, versus .83% and 7.77%, respectively, for the same period the prior year.,Ohio Valley Banc Corp. President and CEO, , stated, ""Our strong start in 2025 was driven by strategic decisions executed by our management team that resulted in strong earning asset growth, an improving net interest margin and a laser focus on controlling overhead expenses. It is satisfying to see the improvement in shareholder value resulting from those decisions."",For the first quarter of 2025, net interest income increased , from the first quarter of 2024. The increase was related to the increase in both average earning assets and the net interest margin. For the first quarter of 2025, average earning assets increased , from the same period last year, led by the , growth in average securities and , growth in average loans. The growth in average securities was related to the Company participating in a program offered by the Ohio Treasurer called Ohio Homebuyer Plus starting in the third quarter of 2024. As a participant in the program, the Company developed the Sweet Home Ohio deposit account to offer participants an above-market interest rate along with a deposit bonus to assist customers in achieving their home savings goals. For each Sweet Home Ohio account that was opened, the Company received a deposit from the Ohio Treasurer at a subsidized interest rate. At ,, the balance of Sweet Home Ohio accounts totaled , and the amount deposited by the Treasurer totaled ,. Since the Treasurer deposits are classified as public funds, which are required to be collateralized, the Company invested the funds in securities to be pledged as collateral to the Treasurer. The investment of these funds was the primary contributor to the increase in securities from the first quarter of 2024. The growth in average loans was related to the commercial and residential real estate lending segments. The growth in these segments was partially offset by a decrease in consumer loans, as this segment was deemphasized by the Company starting in 2024 to focus on more profitable portfolio segments. For the same period, the average balance of cash maintained at the Federal Reserve decreased , to assist with funding loan growth and to generate a higher rate of return. As far as other funding sources, most of the growth occurred in NOW, money market, checking and savings accounts, which increased , from the first quarter of 2024. A large portion of this growth was related to the Ohio Treasurer's matching funds received for the Ohio Homebuyer Plus program. Based on the growth in these lower-cost deposits, the average growth in higher-cost certificates of deposit was limited to , for the first quarter of 2025 versus the same period last year.,For the first quarter of 2025, the net interest margin was 3.85%, an increase from 3.61% for the first quarter of 2024. The increase in the net interest margin was related to the yield on earning assets increasing, while the cost of funding sources decreased. The yield on earning assets improved in relation to the growth in higher yielding securities and loans, while the cost of funding sources decreased as the composition of funding sources shifted to lower cost deposit sources, such as, NOW, money market, checking and savings accounts.,For the three months ended ,, the provision for credit loss expense was ,, a decrease of , from the first quarter of 2024. The provision for credit loss expense for the first quarter of 2025 was primarily related to quarterly net charge-offs of , and additional reserves for certain qualitative risk factors, which was partially offset by lower general reserves associated with the , decrease in total loans since ,. The decrease in total loans was primarily related to a , decrease in a warehouse line of credit extended to another mortgage lender. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was .48% at ,, compared to .46% at , and .37% at ,. The allowance for credit losses was .97% of total loans at ,, compared to .95% at , and .93% at ,.,Noninterest income totaled , for the first quarter of 2025, a nominal decrease of , from the same period last year. Noninterest expense totaled , for the first quarter of 2025, an increase of , from the same period last year. The Company's largest noninterest expense, salaries and employee benefits, decreased ,, or 2.5%, from the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily related to the savings realized from the voluntary early retirement program implemented in 2024, which was partially offset by annual merit increases. For the three months ended ,, data processing expense increased , from the same period last year. The increase was primarily related to debit and credit card processing due to higher transaction volume and conversion costs for the Company's new rewards platform. Also contributing to higher noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2025 was a , increase in marketing expense and a , increase in occupancy expense, as compared to the same period last year.,The Company's total assets at , were ,, an increase of , from ,. The increase in assets was primarily the result of a , increase in balances maintained at the Federal Reserve, as total loans decreased , and total securities decreased ,. As previously mentioned, the decrease in loans was related to a , decrease in a warehouse line of credit extended to another mortgage lender. The paydown was a result of lower mortgage volume due to higher mortgage rates and the increase in the lead bank's internal capacity in relation to a capital infusion. The balance of this line of credit is expected to increase in future periods if mortgage volume increases and the funding needs of the lead bank changes. Absent this decrease, management was pleased with the , in first quarter organic loan growth in the targeted areas of commercial real estate and residential real estate. The decrease in securities was related to the lower need for securities to pledge to the Ohio Treasurer due to a , balance decrease. At ,, total deposits increased , from year end 2024, which occurred primarily within time deposits. Total shareholders' equity increased , from year end 2024.

Smartphones, wearables, ADAS vehicles, smart-buildings, drones, biomedical test kits, and quantum-secure networks all rely on photodiodes, SPAD arrays, or CMOS image sensors to convert light into actionable data. Every new feature such as face authentication, lidar depth mapping, fluorescence-based diagnostics, hyperspectral crop analysis, or single-photon encryption in turn adds more detector channels per device. At the same time, manufacturing efficiencies and government semiconductor incentives are pushing device prices down, widening the addressable pool of applications. Tighter safety, energy-efficiency, and quality regulations further mandate redundant optical sensors in consumer and industrial equipment, turning photodetectors from optional components into non-negotiable design wins and locking in multiyear shipment growth.,Portable photodetectors convert smartphones, wearables, drone payloads, and field-testing gadgets into ubiquitous optical laboratories, shifting measurement from centralized benches to the network edge. Integration with low-power microcontrollers lets environmental scientists verify air quality on mountain trails and agronomists gauge chlorophyll in remote paddies, all without mains electricity. High-volume handset manufacturing cuts module cost below a dollar, making photoplethysmography and time-of-flight depth mapping commonplace in consumer devices. This mass adoption primes suppliers with cash flow to fund R&D for ultraviolet-C pathogen detection. Start-ups exploit open Bluetooth profiles to link photodiodes with cloud dashboards, spawning subscription services for athletes, diabetics, and construction inspectors, thus transforming one-time hardware sales into durable recurring revenue.,Stationary photodetector systems, anchored in traffic intersections, semiconductor fabs, and utility substations, serve applications where stability, throughput, and calibration precision outweigh mobility. Smart-city planners layer lidar-based monitors with multispectral cameras to quantify vehicle counts, pedestrian flow, and emissions in real time, feeding AI engines that optimize signal timing and congestion pricing. In manufacturing, fixed spectrophotometers inspect wafer lithography or beverage clarity at line rates exceeding ten-thousand samples per hour, eliminating costly manual sampling. Utility operators embed photodiodes within switchgear to detect early arc-flash signatures, pre-empting outages. Because these installations lock customers into multi-year calibration and analytics contracts, stationary solutions generate predictable after-sales income that cushions vendors against smartphone-cycle volatility. Over time, artificial-intelligence upgrades further enhance data value and extend replacement intervals.,Consumer electronics set the cadence for innovation in photodetector pixel density, quantum efficiency, and power budget. Each flagship smartphone integrates a growing constellation of optical modules—structured-light projectors for secure face unlock, laser autofocus, depth-sensing SPAD arrays, and ambient-color sensors that tune display white balance in real time. Smart-TV OEMs add gesture-recognition cameras to remote-free interfaces, while VR headsets string four or more inside-out tracking cameras around the visor, each dependent on high-frame-rate photodiodes with low dark current. The fierce feature race forces yearly redesigns, compressing product lifecycles and driving wafer starts at mixed-signal foundries. Volume economics from this consumer onslaught cascade into industrial and medical tiers, lowering barriers for niche deployments. Accessory ecosystems—ring lights, gimbals, and AR spectacles—likewise embed auxiliary photodetectors, magnifying aggregate demand.,ADAS multiplies photodetector channels per car. Solid-state lidar arrays use dense SPAD networks to perceive pedestrians in fog, while interior driver-monitoring cameras employ NIR sensors to track distraction. Euro-NCAP protocols now demand automatic emergency braking and intelligent speed assistance, making multi-spectral optical sensing mandatory for five-star safety ratings. Tier-one suppliers sign decade-long volume contracts, ensuring foundry utilization. Premium carmakers differentiate with 4D lidar featuring single-photon avalanche diodes capable of picosecond timing, commanding high ASPs. Automotive qualification cycles create durable revenue annuities, while over-the-air firmware updates unlock advanced features, encouraging owners to subscribe, further monetizing embedded photodetectors.,In point-of-care diagnostics, photodetectors form the critical read-out engine that turns biochemical reactions into quantifiable digital signals within minutes. Disposable test cartridges—ranging from lateral-flow COVID assays to microfluidic HbA1c panels—use embedded photodiodes or compact CMOS sensors to measure colorimetric or fluorescent changes produced by antigen–antibody binding or enzymatic activity. Because these detectors can resolve subtle intensity shifts, clinicians obtain lab-comparable accuracy at the bedside or pharmacy counter without bulky spectrophotometers. Pharmacy chains bundle readers with subscription data services, generating predictable consumable pull-through. Developing economies adopt low-cost photodiode readers to offset limited lab infrastructure, broadening geographic revenue.,LEED, BREEAM, and national green codes mandate daylight harvesting and occupancy-based lighting controls, all dependent on lux and presence detection. Ultra-low-dark-current diodes keep standby power at micro-watt level, vital for sensor grids in commercial campuses. Performance-contract financiers bundle hardware, installation, and savings guarantees, shifting CapEx to OpEx and accelerating upgrades. LED-driver ICs now ship with integrated photodiode feedback loops, simplifying design and boosting attach rates. Carbon-reduction targets create repeat retrofit cycles as efficacy thresholds tighten.,Hyperspectral drones and satellite surveys rely on high-QE detector arrays to monitor nitrogen uptake, fungal infections, and water stress at centimetre resolution. Variable-rate applicators cut fertilizer and pesticide usage up to thirty percent, justifying sensor investment. Governments subsidize agritech drones to meet sustainable-yield targets, injecting predictable demand. Commodity traders and crop-insurance firms pay for real-time imagery, creating secondary revenue channels for detector OEMs., commands over half of global shipments, buoyed by , smartphone corridors, , display fabs, and , automotive-camera exports; semiconductor-sovereignty subsidies multiply wafer lines and shorten supply chains., and , together generate roughly one-third of revenue, driven by defense imaging, quantum research, and stringent safety rules that lift unit ASPs. , and MEA trail in volume yet post double-digit growth through smart-city and agritech pilots, providing geographic diversification that cushions cyclical downturns.,:,: , ,We have introduced a tailor-made subscription for our customers.

""If approved, zanidatamab would be the first HER2-targeted therapy licensed for this difficult-to-treat cancer in the EU, marking an important milestone in addressing this unmet need. We look forward to the European Commission's decision and the opportunity to provide a new treatment option for patients."",The CHMP recommendation is based on data from the Phase , HERIZON-BTC-01 trial, which evaluated zanidatamab in previously treated, inoperable, and advanced or metastatic HER2-positive BTC., ,While biliary tract cancers (BTCs), which include gallbladder cancer (GBC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA),, account for less than 1% of all human cancers,, CCA is the second most common primary liver cancer after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)., It comprises approximately 10–15% of all primary liver cancers,, and its global mortality rate has risen in recent decades.,Most BTC cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage due to the vague or nonspecific nature of early disease symptoms,, making curative surgery an option for only a minority of patients., Although chemotherapy and, more recently, immunotherapy-based combinations are used in the first-line setting, disease progression is common, and second-line treatment options are, in the absence of molecular analysis, largely limited to chemotherapy., HER2 overexpression or amplification has been identified as a distinct molecular subtype of BTC, and is associated with a worse prognosis compared to HER2-negative BTC., Yet, no HER2-targeted therapies are currently approved for this indication in the European Union (EU).,The CHMP's recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission which has the authority to approve medicines in all EU Member States, ,, ,, and ,, and is expected to make a final decision., ,Zanidatamab is a dual HER2-targeted bispecific antibody that simultaneously binds extracellular domains 2 and 4 on separate HER2 monomers (binding in trans). Binding of zanidatamab with HER2 results in internalization leading to a reduction of the receptor on the cell surface. Zanidatamab induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). These mechanisms result in tumor growth inhibition and tumor cell death.,On ,, in the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval of zanidatamab-hrii (,) for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) biliary tract cancer (BTC), as detected by an FDA-approved test., This accelerated approval was granted based on objective response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the ongoing Phase 3 HERIZON-BTC-302 confirmatory trial., ,Zanidatamab is also being investigated in multiple other clinical trials as a targeted treatment option for patients with solid tumors that express HER2. Zanidatamab is being developed by Jazz and BeiGene, Ltd. (BeiGene) under license agreements from Zymeworks, which first developed the molecule. Jazz has rights to commercialize zanidatamab in the U.S., ,, , and all other territories except for those , territories that Zymeworks previously licensed to BeiGene, Ltd. [which are , (excluding ,), , and ,].,The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for zanidatamab development in patients with previously treated HER2 gene-amplified BTC, and two Fast Track designations for zanidatamab: one as a single agent for refractory BTC and one in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy for 1L gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA). Additionally, zanidatamab has received Orphan Drug designations from FDA for the treatment of BTC and GEA, as well as Orphan Drug designation from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of BTC and gastric cancer. , ,Biliary tract cancers (BTC), including gallbladder cancer and intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, account for <1% of all adult cancers worldwide and are often associated with a poor prognosis., Approximately 26% of patients with BTC are HER2-positive., The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a well-validated target for antitumor therapy in other cancers., Across the U.S., Europe, and Japan, approximately 12,000 people are diagnosed with HER2+ BTC annually., Most patients (>65%) are diagnosed with tumors that cannot be removed surgically., ,Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: ,) is a global biopharma company whose purpose is to innovate to transform the lives of patients and their families.

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lung-immune-cell-type-quietly-controls-inflammation-in-covid-19-302436751.html,"Lung Immune Cell Type ""Quietly"" Controls Inflammation in COVID-19","April 27, 2025","Apr 25, 2025, 11:00 ET",", , /PRNewswire/ -- A rare cell type in the lungs is essential to survival from the COVID-19 virus, a new study shows.,Experiments in mice infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus revealed that the immune cell class in question, called nerve and airway-associated interstitial macrophages, or NAMs, may keep the human immune system's initial counterattack on the virus (lung inflammation) from spiraling out of control to endanger patients. Macrophages are known to be the first responders to infection, as large immune cells capable of devouring invading viruses and the cells they infect.,Led by researchers at NYU Langone Health, the study shifts the focus for treating the disease away from strengthening the immune system attack on the virus and toward better restraint of the immune response, what researchers call ""disease tolerance."",Publishing in the journal , online ,, the researchers found in NAM-depleted mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 that viral infection spread, heightened inflammation and weight loss, and caused all of them to die. By contrast, infected mice with intact NAMs showed limited viral spread, weight loss, and inflammation. All the animals in this group survived infection. NAMs were also shown to restrict the production of highly pro-inflammatory signaling proteins to prevent tissue damage. A unique feature of NAMs, the researchers say, is that their numbers grow over time, where most immune cell sets start to taper off.,""Our findings underscore the critical role of nerve and airway-associated interstitial macrophages in the lungs in regulating the inflammatory response during SARS-Cov-2 infection,"" said study co-lead investigator ,, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. ""The absence of these NAM immune cells leads to an exaggerated inflammatory response against the COVID-19 virus, cell death, and increased viral spread."",The results also showed that NAMs rely on a protein called type 1 interferon receptor, or IFNAR, to have their effect on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. When the team genetically engineered NAMS so that they could no longer produce IFNAR – and so no longer respond to the immune signaling protein interferon – the cells could not tamp down inflammation. In this scenario, the same percentage of mice died as did when NAMS were depleted (100%).  ,Further testing in lung tissue from patients who had been intubated due to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (some survived, and others did not) showed decreased activity in NAM-related genes and heightened inflammation in those who died. This confirmed for the researchers that their NAM findings in mice mimicked what occurs during infection in humans.,""Our study shows that nerve and airway-associated interstitial macrophages in the lungs, rely on type 1 interferon signaling for their expansion and normal functioning during SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" said senior study investigator ,, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Microbiology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.,The same NYU Langone team discovered in 2020 that a small fraction (less than 5%) of lung macrophages acted differently during infection with the influenza virus by not attacking it. Instead, they found that these cells, which they named NAMs, tamped down the initial immune response and prevented prolonged inflammation from causing damage to lung tissue as it attempted to heal. This led the team to suspect that NAMs might play a similar role in COVID-19.,""The new work unveils nerve and airway-associated interstitial macrophages as key players in the choreography of recovery—poised to silence the alarms of inflammation and restore calm, even in the midst of interferon's call to amplify the immune response,"" said Benjamin tenOever, PhD, the Jan T. Vilcek Professor of Molecular Pathogenesis, and chair, of the Department of Microbiology at NYU Langone.,Moving forward, the researchers plan to study NAM pathways to determine how the macrophage subset moderates inflammation. Specifically, the team plans to investigate type 1 interferon signaling and how it triggers NAM growth in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.,If further experiments prove successful, Khanna says his team's findings could be used to develop treatment strategies that harness IFNAR signaling to promote disease tolerance. This approach may apply to COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and pulmonary fibrosis.,Funding support for this study was provided by National Institutes of Health grants P30CA016087, R01AI143861, R01AI162774, R33GM147800, U01AG088351, F32HL154598, and 5T3-A1100853.

Firstly, rising concerns about carbon emissions have prompted a shift from conventional fossil fuels to alternative fuels in both military and civil aviation, supporting the transition towards more sustainable aviation solutions., ,The US government's commitment to reducing emissions has led to the introduction of tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel, incentivizing production and adoption. Furthermore, airlines like United Air, KLM, and JetBlue have begun integrating sustainable aviation fuel in 50% blends with conventional fuels, demonstrating its feasibility and viability. The successful demonstration by United Airlines, operating the first commercial flight with 100% sustainable aviation fuel, has proven the technology's effectiveness and contributed to its wider acceptance. Lastly, the US government's net-zero emissions target by 2050 and support for sustainable fuel initiatives are expected to lead to price reductions and further increase demand for sustainable aviation fuels., ,Based on the fuel type, the sustainable aviation fuel market is divided into biofuel, hydrogen fuel, power-to-liquid and gas-to-liquid. In 2024, the biofuel type segment dominated the sustainable aviation fuel market, and the power-to-liquid type segment is anticipated to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period in US. The established infrastructure for producing and distributing biofuels is a key factor driving its dominance, along with government incentives and subsidies supporting biofuel production. Additionally, biofuels' compatibility with existing aviation infrastructure allows for easier adoption compared to newer fuel types like hydrogen. The cost-effectiveness and sustainability of biofuels, coupled with their lower carbon emissions, further contribute to their dominance in the market.,Moreover, the ongoing advancements in biofuel technologies and scalability in production processes are expected to support the increasing demand for sustainable aviation fuel in the US.,Based on biofuel blending capacity, the , is categorized into below 30%, 30 – 50% and above 50%. During the forecast period, the above 50% biofuel blending capacity segment accounted for the fastest-growing CAGR in the sustainable aviation fuel market in the US. The increased regulatory support and subsidies for higher biofuel blends are driving the growth of the segment. Additionally, the growing demand for more sustainable and environmentally-friendly aviation fuels is contributing to the adoption of higher biofuel blending capacities.

High-speed broadband, cloud platforms, and consumer wearables now deliver hospital-grade monitoring and video consultations directly to patients' homes, slashing readmissions and facility overhead while maintaining clinical visibility. Permanent reimbursement parity, value-based payment models, and clearer telehealth regulations have removed financial and legal barriers, unlocking capital spending by providers and payers alike. Meanwhile, AI-powered triage, interoperable APIs, and cybersecurity advances streamline workflows and elevate patient safety, making virtual modalities not just a contingency plan but an indispensable, cost-effective pillar of mainstream healthcare delivery.,Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) is a foundational catalyst for virtual care because it extends observation beyond hospitals, capturing biometrics via connected sensors. Insurers reimburse RPM when it cuts readmissions, compelling adoption. Cloud analytics convert raw streams into risk-stratified alerts, freeing specialists. Manufacturers earn subscription revenue on connectivity and dashboards, stabilizing margins. Seamless EHR integration elevates RPM's impact across chronic-disease management, post-surgical follow-up, and geriatric pathways at population scale.,Hospital-at-Home (HaH) programs relocate acute-level treatments such as IV antibiotics, oxygen therapy, continuous telemetry into residences, freeing inpatient beds and lowering infection risk. Logistics and on-demand nursing enable same-day delivery of pumps and imaging. Payers favor HaH because episode costs drop up to forty percent, while satisfaction rises. Providers integrate teleconsultations, wearables, and AI alerts to maintain oversight. HaH proves virtual care's safety and efficacy across urban, suburban, and rural settings worldwide today.,The hospital segment is a pivotal revenue engine: integrated delivery networks use tele-ICU dashboards, e-consult portals, and AI triage bots to spread expertise. Capital budgets for digital transformation fund enterprise telehealth suites and secure data centers. Teaching hospitals embed telemedicine in curricula, cultivating a workforce versed in virtual workflows while facilitating seamless patient handoffs across the continuum of care.,Machine-learning algorithms embedded in virtual-care platforms screen symptoms, wearable streams, and medical histories, triaging patients, routing them to appropriate clinicians, and recommending evidence-based interventions. Automation reduces cognitive load, allowing scarce specialists to focus on complex cases, effectively stretching workforce capacity. Clinical validation studies show concordance rates rivalling experienced physicians for common ailments, bolstering trust. Vendors monetise AI modules through per-member subscriptions and outcome-based contracts, creating recurring revenue. Regulators have published adaptive-algorithm guidance, clarifying compliance and reducing go-to-market risk. As AI triage lowers wait times and improves outcomes, institutions embed it deeper into care pathways, further normalising virtual modalities across primary, acute, and chronic settings.,Aging populations and clinician burnout have created substantial workforce gaps worldwide, forcing health systems to seek scalable service models. Virtual modalities enable one physician to supervise multiple facilities or allied professionals remotely, maximising utilisation. Multistate licensing compacts and cross-border telehealth accords extend practitioner reach, while tele-rounding software offsets staffing deficits without compromising quality. Hospital boards increasingly view telehealth as a workforce multiplier rather than discretionary IT spend, allocating capital accordingly. Start-ups offering remote specialist networks attract venture funding, fuelling continuous platform innovation. Flexible scheduling through virtual shifts elevates job satisfaction and retention, easing burnout and ensuring sustained clinician engagement with digital-care ecosystems.,Post-pandemic policy reforms established reimbursement parity between telehealth and in-person visits across many jurisdictions.

The court's ruling left in place FDA's prior determination that all doses of Wegovy, and Ozempic, are fully available nationwide and that Novo Nordisk's supply of these FDA-approved medicines is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide patient demand. With the FDA's resolution of the shortage of Ozempic, and Wegovy,, as left in place by this court ruling, it is illegal under US compounding laws to make or sell knockoff ""semaglutide drugs,"" with rare exceptions.,
              ,In light of the court's decision today, FDA may immediately take action against 503A pharmacies compounding knockoff versions of Novo Nordisk's FDA-approved semaglutide medicines. The ruling also means the grace period for , outsourcing facilities to compound semaglutide injectable drugs will expire on ,, and FDA may take enforcement action against these entities after that date.,This latest win on behalf of patients follows another key decision by the District Court for the Southern District of ,, where a federal judge entered a final judgment and permanent injunction in favor of Novo Nordisk, against a 503A pharmacy, MediOak Pharmacy LLC, permanently prohibiting them from marketing or selling compounded ""semaglutide"" knockoff drugs.,""We are pleased the court has rejected the compounders' attempts to undermine FDA's data-based decision that the shortage of Wegovy,and Ozempic, is resolved,"" said ,, Corporate Vice President, Legal and US General Counsel, ,. ""FDA's determination was based on a thorough review of Novo Nordisk's stable and growing supply of these important FDA-approved medicines. With the end of the shortage of Wegovy,and Ozempic,, no patient should have to be exposed to unsafe, inauthentic 'semaglutide' drugs. Patient safety remains a top priority for Novo Nordisk and the extensive nationwide legal actions we have taken to protect Americans from the health risks posed by illegitimate 'semaglutide' drugs are working. We will continue driving these actions forward and escalate our efforts as necessary, while closely engaging with regulators and law enforcement."",The resolution of the semaglutide injection shortage and the court's ruling also help protect patients against the proliferation of unsafe and unlawful drugs compounded using imports of synthetic ""semaglutide"" active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that are manufactured overseas. A recently published Brookings Institute report titled , confirms that many US patients are being exposed to unsafe and illegal imports of synthetic semaglutide APIs from ,. The report highlights numerous issues, including that manufacturers of chemically synthesized semaglutide API have no external reference standard for quality and instead determine specifications themselves. It also demonstrated that three Chinese firms are responsible for 20% of the reported quantity of semaglutide imported into the US between , and , and have never been inspected by FDA, as of ,. Additionally, another three Chinese firms, responsible for nearly 45% of reported imported volume during this 18-month period, were cited during their latest FDA inspection for current good manufacturing practice violations. As this report shows, the quality of API originating from , and used in compounded ""semaglutide"" in the US cannot be assured and puts patients at serious risk. Novo Nordisk does , directly or indirectly distribute the semaglutide API in its FDA-approved medicines to any entity for use in compounding.,To date, the company has filed 111 lawsuits in federal courts across 32 states against entities unlawfully marketing and selling compounded ""semaglutide,"" including drugs that pose significant risks to patient safety due to high levels of impurities (as high as 33%) or misbranded due to inaccurately labeled strengths.,Many of these courts have already issued injunctions permanently prohibiting these entities from the unlawful marketing and sales of compounded drugs:,Dozens of other courts have entered permanent injunctions against the entities sued by Novo Nordisk, permanently forbidding them from falsely claiming that knockoff ""semaglutide"" drugs: (1) are genuine Novo Nordisk medicines; (2) are approved by FDA, are authentic generic medicines, or are safe and effective; (3) achieve any therapeutic result or are safe or effective based on the clinical trial results for Novo Nordisk's approved medicines; and (4) contain semaglutide that has been approved by FDA, is supplied by Novo Nordisk, or is the same as that in Wegovy, and Ozempic,.,The court orders also direct businesses to correct misimpressions among patients that were caused by the defendants' deceptive practices. This includes posting prominent disclosures in marketing and advertising to make clear that the unapproved compounded drugs have not been reviewed or approved by the FDA, that the manufacturing processes used to make the drugs are not FDA-reviewed, and that actual FDA-approved semaglutide medicines are available.,Novo Nordisk supports the actions that have already been taken by law enforcement to protect patients from illegal marketing and sales of compounded drugs. A bipartisan coalition of 38 state Attorneys General have , to take swift action against compounding pharmacies that ""cut corners in pursuit of a quick profit"" and sell knockoff drugs that could lead to ""serious public health issues."" The , Attorney General recently issued a , about letters it sent to 14 entities warning them to stop deceiving patients into believing that compounded drugs are approved by the FDA or have been reviewed for safety, effectiveness, or quality and declaring that patients ""deserve clear and accurate information about the medication they're putting in their bodies."" Similarly, in ,, the , Attorney General , cease-and-desist letters to five Chicagoland med spas advertising name brand medications like Wegovy, and Ozempic, but ""instead offering unapproved versions of these products that may put people's health at risk.""

Such a large patient population not only imposes a heavy mental and economic burden on families but also has a profound impact on social development.,The growing population of individuals with autism lacks corresponding relief pathways. On the one hand, there is an insufficient number of professional child rehabilitation institutions, especially in grassroots and rural areas. On the other hand, among existing rehabilitation institutions, there are significant differences in service levels and treatment outcomes. Due to technological and personnel quality limitations, some institutions struggle to provide high-quality rehabilitation plans that meet the individual needs of children.,In addition to the relative scarcity of quality rehabilitation services, high rehabilitation costs, limited training resources, and inconsistent training programs also place a heavy burden on many families. Many ""children of the stars"" thus miss the best intervention opportunities due to ignorance or helplessness.,Care for vulnerable groups and marginalized populations often reflects the level of civilization in a society. The issue of autism urgently needs more attention and emphasis from various sectors of society.,As a US-listed company, we have always believed that enterprises are not only entities pursuing economic interests but should also shoulder social responsibilities. Children with autism, as a vulnerable group in society, their growth and development are related to the happiness and future of countless families. By engaging in the field of autism rehabilitation, we hope to use our technological advantages to light up a beacon of hope for these children, help them approach the life state of normal children as much as possible, and integrate into society. This is not only a feedback to society but also our mission as an enterprise.,Founded in 2014, Xinlantian has deep professional expertise in the field of rehabilitation training for children with autism. It has not only meticulously crafted a mature and comprehensive training system for children with autism, covering curriculum development and textbook research, but also established a comprehensive teacher and parent education and training system. Xinlantian's independently developed ""Targeted Neural Training Method"" has achieved remarkable results after years of practical verification. This method targets the neurodevelopmental characteristics of children with autism and effectively improves their language expression and social interaction abilities through scientific training methods.,The partnership between Baijiayun and Xinlantian aims to use products and AI technology to enter this challenging field, empower autism rehabilitation services, help more ""children from the stars"" live like normal children, and enable more individuals with autism and their families to lead better lives.,Why can Baijiayun shoulder this mission? The answer lies in our technological moat and ecological synergy. Over the past decade, Baijiayun has continuously deepened its presence in the education sector, providing users with comprehensive audio-visual solutions centered around knowledge dissemination and educational service delivery, serving tens of thousands of online education enterprises and public schools. The rehabilitation training of children with autism is actually a highly personalized one-on-one scenario, which coincides with Baijiayun's advantages in online teaching and the integration of online and offline products. With the continuous development of AI technology, Baijiayun has also continuously deepened its application in the field of educational technology, developing multiple AI products, intelligent agents, and technical tools, converting technological potential into educational effectiveness, and facilitating the realization of large-scale personalized teaching. Professional fields require vertical deepening, and these experiences and products can also be applied in the field of special education, bringing new possibilities for more children of the stars.,In the AI era, we can better bridge the characteristics and limitations between personalization and scalability in traditional education, which are like the two ends of a scale, making ""scalable and personalized teaching and learning"" possible. Regarding the measure of Baijiayun's layout in the field of special education, Li Haoying, the current Vice President of the Education Innovation and Evaluation Branch of the Chinese Society for Futures Studies, stated: Achieving personalized rehabilitation training through technological means will greatly enhance rehabilitation outcomes and bring new hope to children with autism and their families. Their efforts are expected to help millions of individuals with autism lead happier and more dignified lives, alleviate societal burdens, and promote harmonious social development.,We fully understand investors' attention on direction focus, business implementation feasibility, and return cycles. Here, we announce that the company will invest tens of millions of dollars over five years to build new ecosystem for autism rehabilitation, hoping to showcase our determination and efforts in deepening our work.,Firstly, Baijiayun will continuously increase investment in technological research and development, further refine the intelligent diagnostic assistance platform, and promote the application of new technologies such as AI large models and VR in the field of autism rehabilitation. Combining Baijiayun's previous technological achievements, the company will deeply explore and develop an intelligent diagnostic assistance platform focused on the field of autism rehabilitation. Through big data analysis and machine learning algorithms, it will thoroughly analyze the specific symptoms and past training records of each child with autism, accurately generating personalized rehabilitation training plans. For example, if the platform data analysis finds that a child is making slow progress in language training, the system will automatically increase the duration and intensity of relevant training content or adjust the training methods to ensure that each child receives the most effective rehabilitation training in the shortest time possible.,Secondly, Baijiayun will allocate these funds to the development of standardized curriculum systems, the construction of professional teacher training systems, the output of clinical intervention methodologies, and the digital adaptation of service processes. A scientific and systematic curriculum system is the cornerstone of rehabilitation training. In curriculum and service system construction, Baijiayun will collaborate with Xinlantian's professional team to develop standardized curricula based on the different developmental stages and symptom characteristics of children with autism, ensuring that rehabilitation training in different regions and institutions adheres to unified high-quality standards. At the same time, it will strengthen professional training for rehabilitation trainers, enhance their professional skills, and ensure that every trainer can proficiently apply advanced intervention methods.,Finally, Baijiayun plans to empower rehabilitation institutions and establish standardized models through the integration of ""technology + service."" Over the past decade, Baijiayun has deepened its presence in the field of AI and audio-visual technology, being the most knowledgeable AI application service provider in education. Our one-stop products and services can fully support the construction of digital platforms, covering aspects such as store management, service process optimization, traffic distribution, AI tools, and data platforms. With the SaaS system, Baijiayun plans to subsequently output mature standards to more regions, providing franchisors with comprehensive empowerment including brand support, technical training, and operational guidance.,From a market perspective, the autism rehabilitation market size is showing explosive growth trends. Data shows that the global autism spectrum disorder market size was approximately , in 2024 and is expected to reach , by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.5% from 2024 to 2033. In ,, with the continuous improvement of society's awareness of autism and the growing demand for rehabilitation training from families, the autism rehabilitation market size is expected to reach hundreds of billions of yuan level.,Such a vast market size provides us with broad development space. Leveraging our experience and advantages in technological research and development, platform construction, and market operations, we are confident in achieving significant results in this field, creating new growth points for the company's performance, and achieving a win-win situation for both corporate and social values.,Lastly, we would like to thank all investors again for their trust and support in us. We believe that the true value of an enterprise lies in solving social problems through commercial methods and promoting social progress with professional capabilities. Although we are well aware that there will be many challenges on the road to exploring the field of autism rehabilitation, we are confident and determined to overcome difficulties and achieve our goals.,We will continue to pay attention to the feedback and suggestions from partners.

(NASDAQ: ,) announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued a positive opinion on the marketing authorization application for Sephience™ (sepiapterin) for the treatment of children and adults living with phenylketonuria (PKU). The opinion includes a broad label inclusive of all ages and disease severities.,""This positive opinion is great news for the PKU patient community in , for whom there remains a significant unmet medical need,"" said Matthew B. Klein, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of PTC Therapeutics. ""We look forward to initiating the European launch immediately following the adoption of this positive opinion by the European Commission. The data collected to date continue to support the potential for Sephience to provide a safe and effective treatment that not only lowers phenylalanine levels but also enables diet liberalization even for those with the most severe disease subtypes."",Launch planning in , is well underway with priorities in , and other key European markets where named patient access will be immediately available.,PTC expects the European Commission to ratify the marketing authorization for Sephience in approximately two months. The decision will be applicable to all 27 European Union member states, as well as ,, , and ,.,The New Drug Application (NDA) for sepiapterin is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of ,. Review of approval applications is ongoing in several other countries including , and Brazil. ,Sephience, an oral formulation of synthetic sepiapterin, has a dual mechanism of action to increase activity of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. First, Sephience is a precursor compound that is rapidly absorbed and converted intracellularly to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a critical cofactor of PAH. Sephience also has an independent pharmacological chaperone effect, correcting PAH misfolding to enhance the enzyme function. Through this dual mechanism of action, Sephience effectively reduces blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels and has the potential to treat a broad range of PKU patients.,Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare, inherited metabolic disease, which affects the brain. It is caused by a defect in the gene that helps create the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine (Phe). If left untreated or poorly managed, Phe – an essential amino acid found in all proteins and most foods – can build up to harmful levels in the body. This causes severe and irreversible disabilities, such as permanent intellectual disability, seizures, delayed development, memory loss, and behavioral and emotional problems. Newborns with PKU initially don't have any symptoms, but symptoms are usually progressive, and damage caused by toxic levels of Phe in the first few years of life is irreversible. Diagnosis of PKU usually takes place during newborn screening programs. There are an estimated 58,000 people living with PKU globally.,PTC is a global biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes clinically differentiated medicines that provide benefits to children and adults living with rare disorders. PTC's ability to innovate new therapies and to globally commercialize products is the foundation that drives investment in a robust and diversified pipeline of transformative medicines.

The Company believes that operating net income is useful in periods with certain significant items such as merger-related expenses or Day 2 non-PCD provision. The operating net income is more reflective of management's ability to grow the business and manage expenses. Adjusted non-interest expense also removes these significant items, such as merger-related expenses. Management believes it represents a more normalized non-interest expense total for periods with identified significant items.,Total revenue is a non-GAAP measure and is derived from total interest income less total interest expense plus total non-interest income. We believe that total revenue is a useful tool to determine how the Company is managing its business and demonstrates how stable our revenue sources are from period to period.,Pretax, pre-provision earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is based on adjusting income before income taxes and to exclude provision for (recapture of) credit losses. We believe that pretax, pre-provision earnings is a useful tool to help evaluate the ability to provide for credit costs through operations and provides an additional basis to compare results between periods by isolating the impact of provision for (recapture of) credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods.,In management's view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Company's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital strength because they eliminate intangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders' equity.,The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest income, we use net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. FTE net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit on certain financial interest earning assets, whose interest is tax-exempt, to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. Management believes FTE net interest income is a standard practice in the banking industry, and when net interest income is adjusted on an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income and this adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. FTE net interest income is only used for calculating FTE net interest margin, which is calculated by annualizing FTE net interest income and then dividing by the average earning assets. The tax rate used for this adjustment is 21%. Net interest income shown elsewhere in this presentation is GAAP net interest income.,CONTACT:,Investor Relations,703-666-3555 ,SOURCE Burke & Herbert Financial Services Corp."

Customary brokerage charges may apply to such transactions. From the last day of trading through the Liquidation Date, shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market.,In anticipation of the liquidation, the Fund will be managed in a manner intended to facilitate its orderly liquidation, such as by raising cash or making investments in other highly liquid assets. As a result, in preparation for the liquidation, all or a portion of the Fund may not be invested in a manner consistent with its stated investment strategy, which may prevent the Fund from achieving its investment objective.,On or about the Liquidation Date, the Fund will liquidate its assets and distribute cash pro rata to all remaining shareholders. These distributions are taxable events. In addition, these payments to shareholders will include accrued capital gains and dividends, if any. As calculated on the Liquidation Date, the Fund's net asset value will reflect the costs of liquidating the Fund. Once the distributions are complete, the Fund will terminate.,If you would like additional information, please call: 855-726-4388 or visit: ,.,Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. There is no guarantee the Fund will achieve its stated investment objectives. The Fund is non-diversified. Its concentration in an industry or sector can increase the impact of, and potential losses associated with, the risks from investing in those industries/sectors. Investments in the energy industry are subject to significant volatility due to changes in commodity prices. Additional risks include changes in exchange rates, government regulation, world events, economic and political conditions in the countries where energy companies are located or do business, and risks for environmental damage claims. The Fund's Index measures the performance of equity securities of companies engaged in the exploration and production of natural gas. The Fund's Index does not measure the performance of direct investment in natural gas and, therefore, may not move in the same direction and to the same extent as natural gas. International investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. The Fund may invest in securities denominated in foreign currencies. Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if currencies of the underlying securities depreciate against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currencies. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. Because the Fund is new, investors in the Fund bear the risk that the Fund may not be successful in implementing its investment strategy, may not employ a successful investment strategy, or may fail to attract sufficient assets under management to realize economies of scale, any of which could result in the Fund being liquidated at any time without shareholder approval and at a time that may not be favorable for all shareholders. Such liquidation could have negative tax consequences for shareholders and will cause shareholders to incur expenses of liquidation. The Fund is a recently organized investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors have no track record or history on which to base their investment decision. Moreover, investors will not be able to evaluate the Fund against one or more comparable funds on the basis of relative performance until the Funds has established a track record.,Investment Products and Services:,NOT FDIC INSURED | NO BANK GUARANTEE | MAY LOSE VALUE,SOURCE Exchange Traded Concepts, LLC"

Under the managed distribution plan, distributions are sourced from income and also may be sourced from paid-in capital and/or capital gains. The fund's distributions in any period may be more or less than the net return earned by the fund on its investments and therefore should not be used as a measure of performance or confused with yield or income. Distributions in excess of fund returns will cause the fund's NAV to decline. Investors should not draw any conclusions about the fund's investment performance from the amount of its distribution or from the terms of its managed distribution plan.,The Allspring Income Opportunities Fund is a closed-end high-yield bond fund. The fund's investment objective is to seek a high level of current income. The fund may, as a secondary objective, seek capital appreciation to the extent it is consistent with its investment objective.,The Allspring Multi-Sector Income Fund is a closed-end income fund. The fund's investment objective is to seek a high level of current income consistent with limiting its overall exposure to domestic interest rate risk.,The Allspring Utilities and High Income Fund is a closed-end equity and high-yield bond fund. The fund's investment objective is to seek a high level of current income and moderate capital growth with an emphasis on providing tax-advantaged dividend income.,The final determination of the source of all dividend distributions in the current year will be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax-reporting purposes will depend upon a fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. Each fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell shareholders how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.,These closed-end funds are no longer available in public offerings and are only offered through broker-dealers on the secondary market. A closed-end fund is not required to buy its shares back from investors upon request. Shares of a fund may trade at either a premium or discount relative to the fund's net asset value, and there can be no assurance that any discount will decrease. The values of, and/or the income generated by, securities held by a fund may decline due to general market conditions or other factors, including those directly involving the issuers of such securities.,Equity securities fluctuate in value in response to factors specific to the issuer of the security. Debt securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk, and high-yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality have a much greater risk of default and their values tend to be more volatile than higher-rated securities with similar maturities. Foreign investments may contain more risk due to the inherent risks associated with changing political climates, foreign market instability, and foreign currency fluctuations. Risks of international investing are magnified in emerging or developing markets. Funds that concentrate their investments in a single industry or sector may face increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified funds due to adverse developments within that industry or sector. Small- and mid-cap securities may be subject to special risks associated with narrower product lines and limited financial resources compared with their large-cap counterparts. Each fund is leveraged through a revolving credit facility and also may incur leverage by issuing preferred shares in the future.,The use of leverage results in certain risks, including, among others, the likelihood of greater volatility of the net asset value and the market price of common shares. Derivatives involve additional risks, including interest rate risk, credit risk, the risk of improper valuation, and the risk of noncorrelation to the relevant instruments they are designed to hedge or closely track.

              ,""I am humbly grateful and happy to announce that we officially received FDA 510(k) Class II approval of FROG,"" said Carr. ""This milestone is not just a win for Carr Tech—it's a win for every healthcare worker who's ever struggled with cumbersome drug prep protocols and every patient who deserves safer medication handling."",FROG is the first and only all-in-one filter needle that eliminates multiple steps from the current multi-component method of drawing medication from glass ampoules. Traditional procedures often involve using separate filter and non-filter needles to prevent the risk of glass particle contamination—a process that is time-consuming, costly, and prone to error. FROG's innovative design consolidates these steps, reducing procedural risk, streamlining workflow, and enhancing patient safety.,510(k) Class II approval is a rigorous regulatory hurdle that signifies a product is ""substantially equivalent"" in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed device. For startups, it represents a critical gatekeeper to commercialization—one that only a fraction of emerging businesses successfully pass. According to industry data, fewer than 12% of medical device startups reach FDA clearance. The average cost to bring a new device to market can exceed , and take up to a decade, not including the investment needed to sustain a business until profitability.,Carr, who started Carr Tech as a one-person operation driven by her experiences in hospital pharmacies, credits her team and ecosystem of supporters for the achievement. ""Thank you to the Carr Tech team, our incredible supporters, Gilero (a Sanner Group company), Kymanox, TEDCO, Old Line Capital Partners, and especially FITCI for being our home base and springboard,"" she said. ""Thank you for believing in me throughout the journey."",Carr Tech's success highlights the critical role of business incubators like the Frederick Innovative Technology Center, Inc. (FITCI), which supported Carr Tech through mentorship, work/lab space, a support community, and connections to funding resources and commercialization partners.,""This is a momentous achievement,"" said ,, CEO of FITCI. ""FDA approval is one of the most difficult and resource-intensive barriers for startups in the life sciences. Most companies never make it this far. That's what makes this moment so meaningful—for Carr Tech, for ,, and for every aspiring innovator. It proves that with the right support and extraordinary determination, even a small team can overcome big hurdles and change lives."",Carr's inspiration for FROG stemmed from years spent witnessing the impact of filter failure in hospital emergency settings. Her concern was that injections contaminated with microscopic glass shards could lead to preventable complications. Determined to find a solution, she leveraged her pharmaceutical background to design a single-use, easy-to-use device that minimizes the risk of error and improves compliance with safety protocols.,The FDA clearance marks a turning point for Carr Tech. With the green light to begin full-scale production and sales, the company is positioned to bring this safer alternative to hospitals, surgical centers, and clinics nationwide, ending outdated ampoule-handling procedures. Plans for manufacturing scale-up and expanded distribution are already underway – even on a global scale.,""This approval allows us to take the next step in our mission to revolutionize medication safety,"" said Carr. ""We're just getting started."",For more information about Carr Tech Corp or the FROG device, visit ,.,Founded by ,, Carr Tech Corp is a ,-based medical device company focused on innovating safer, smarter solutions for medication delivery.

Wer auf veraltetes Equipment setzt, riskiert, im entscheidenden Moment die Chance zu verpassen. HIKMICRO bietet die perfekte Lösung für erfolgreiche Jagden – bei jedem Licht und bis tief in die Nacht.,
              ,Im vergangenen Jahr haben sich Jäger weltweit von klassischer Optik verabschiedet und sind auf das , umgestiegen. Mit seiner unschlagbaren Kombination aus digitaler und thermischer Bildtechnik revolutioniert es das Jagen rund um die Uhr. Dieses bahnbrechende Digitalfernglas ist Ausdruck von HIKMICROs Anspruch, sich nicht länger von den Grenzen herkömmlicher Dämmerungsoptik einschränken zu lassen.,Das HABROK , wurde von HIKMICRO in enger Zusammenarbeit mit Jägern entwickelt. Durch den intensiven Austausch mit der weltweiten Jagd-Community basiert die außergewöhnliche Dämmerungsleistung des HABROK , auf echtem Feedback aus der Praxis – von Jägern, die ihre Ausrüstung unter härtesten Bedingungen testen. Genau deshalb hat das HABROK , klassische Ferngläser längst abgelöst und ist zur ersten Wahl für Jäger geworden, die maximale Leistung in anspruchsvollsten Dämmerungssituationen erwarten.,Während andere Ferngläser bei untergehender Sonne versagen, stellt sich das HABROK , der Herausforderung – als der ultimative Begleiter für die Jagd bei wenig Licht. Mit 95 % Lichttransmission übertrifft es selbst traditionelle 10x56-Ferngläser und zeigt dort Stärke, wo andere an ihre Grenzen stoßen. Wenn ein vorsichtiger Bock im letzten Licht aus dem Bestand zieht, ist das HABROK , genau dort in seinem Element – es durchdringt die Dunkelheit und enthüllt die Geheimnisse der Dämmerung. Wo andere nur Schwärze sehen, liefert das HABROK , beeindruckende Details – gestochen scharf, hell und mit höchster Klarheit.,Während herkömmliche Optiken das goldene Leuchten des Sonnenuntergangs in trübe Grautöne verwandeln, zeigt das HABROK , die Natur in ihrer ganzen Schönheit – in lebendigem , UHD und brillanter Farbdarstellung. Kein Detail bleibt verborgen: der kastanienbraune Schimmer und die feine Struktur der Decke, das kaum merkliche Zucken eines Blattes am Waldrand oder das letzte Glitzern der Abendsonne auf dem Gehörn des Bocks, der kurz innehält, um die kühle Abendluft zu wittern. Diese Details sind nicht nur wertvolle Hinweise für den Jäger –  sie machen den besonderen Reiz der Jagd aus. Die Dämmerung wird zur Bühne für das HABROK ,, das mit seiner visuellen Magie beeindruckt und Momente schafft, die unvergesslich bleiben.,Das schwindende Licht gibt dem Bock das Vertrauen, sich aus der Deckung des Waldes zu wagen. Der Jäger zoomt näher heran und verfolgt jeden vorsichtigen Schritt, während das Wild den schützenden Einstand verlässt und das offene Feld betritt. Selbst bei 22-facher Vergrößerung bleibt das Bild dank der fortschrittlichen elektronischen Bildstabilisierung (EIS) des HABROK , absolut ruhig. Die Hände des Jägers zittern – vom Aufstieg und der Aufregung, solch einem starken Stück gegenüberzustehen – doch das Bild bleibt vollkommen stabil. Ob große Distanz oder pochender Puls – durch das HABROK , bleibt die Sicht klar und ruhig, sodass der Jäger sich ganz auf das Wesentliche konzentrieren kann: den Moment der Dämmerungsjagd., verschwindet – der Jäger muss seine Position wechseln, um ihn weiter im Blick zu behalten. Zum Glück ist das HABROK , leicht, kompakt und vereint alle Beobachtungsmodi in einem Gerät. Ohne das Gewicht verschiedener Optiken bewegt sich der Jäger mühelos weiter – seinem Ziel stets auf der Spur. Von einem neuen Punkt aus wechselt er vom 5,5–22x60 Fernglas in den Wärmebildmodus. Die Wärmesignatur des Bocks leuchtet wie ein Signalfeuer – die Pirsch geht weiter. Als die Dunkelheit endgültig einsetzt, schaltet der Jäger das HABROK , in den Nachtmodus. Mit dem integrierten IR-Strahler wird die Nacht zum Tag. Das gestochen scharfe, monochrome Bild bestätigt: das ist das Stück, auf das er gewartet hat.Mit dem integrierten Laser-Entfernungsmesser (1000 m Reichweite) bestimmt der Jäger präzise die Distanz zum Ziel. Er nimmt das Gewehr in den Anschlag und die Dämmerungsjagd endet erfolgreich, während der Mond über der Wildnis aufgeht.,Dämmerung ist der ultimative Härtetest. Das HABROK , besteht ihn – mit Bravour.,Die Jagd erreicht ihren entscheidenden Moment in den magischen Minuten zwischen Tag und Nacht. Genau dann wird das HABROK , zum unverzichtbaren Werkzeug für den Erfolg – es verschafft dem Jäger wertvolle Zusatzzeit, wenn klassische Ferngläser längst an ihre Grenzen stoßen. Mit herausragender Leistung bei wenig Licht, , UHD Vollfarbbild und stabiler Sicht dank fortschrittlicher EIS-Technologie, liefert das HABROK , auch im letzten Licht des Tages ein klares Bild – genau dann, wenn der Jäger es am meisten braucht. Ob ein Bock vorsichtig aus der Deckung tritt oder ein Stück Wild schnell über das dämmernde Feld zieht – kein Detail bleibt verborgen. Starte in die neue Saison mit dem Maßstab für exzellente Jagdoptik bei Tag, Dämmerung und Nacht: HABROK , – die Nr. 1 für Jagd ohne Lichtgrenzen.,HIKMICRO steht nie still und arbeitet kontinuierlich daran, die besten digitalen und thermischen Jagdlösungen auf dem Markt zu entwickeln. Der nächste Meilenstein auf dem Weg zur Überlegenheit bei allen Lichtverhältnissen ist das ,-Upgrade des beliebten HABROK HQ35L 5.5–22x. Dieses Modell wurde gezielt auf Basis des Feedbacks erfahrener Rehwildjäger überarbeitet und weiter verfeinert. Für beeindruckende Bildqualität bei Tag, Dämmerung und Nacht sorgt ein leistungsstarker 640er Wärmebilddetektor mit einem NETD-Wert von 20 mK, kombiniert mit gestochen scharfer , UHD-Auflösung. Die überarbeitete Version überzeugt mit einer Identifikationsreichweite von bis zu 250 Metern, einem integrierten Laser-Entfernungsmesser mit 1.000 Meter Reichweite sowie einem abnehmbaren IR-Strahler. Auch Funktionen wie Video- und Audioaufzeichnung sind selbstverständlich integriert.

Using outdated equipment can result in missed opportunities at the vital moment, but HIKMICRO has the ultimate solution for hunting success at any light level and into the night.,
              ,Over the past year, hunters around the world have abandoned traditional optics in favour of the HIKMICRO HABROK ,, which has revolutionized round-the-clock hunting with its unrivalled digital and thermal capability. These game-changing digital binoculars are born out of HIKMICRO's refusal to accept the traditional twilight limitations. HABROK , has rewritten the rules of low-light hunting, enabling hunters to enjoy crystal-clear viewing from daylight to total darkness – it's not just a hunting tool, it's a movement.,HIKMICRO developed the HABROK , by listening to hunters. This collaboration with the global hunting community means that HABROK 4K's ultra-refined twilight performance is based on real-world feedback from the people who are putting their kit to the ultimate test. That's why HABROK , has superseded traditional binoculars to become the go-to choice for hunters who demand the best performance in the toughest twilight scenarios.,While other optics fail as the sun sinks beneath the hills, HABROK , rises to the challenge to become the ultimate low-light hunting companion. Outperforming traditional 10x56 binoculars with its 95% light transmission, it excels where the rest falter. Just like the wary buck emerging cautiously from cover in the fading light, HABROK , is now in its natural environment – cutting through the darkness to reveal the secrets of the twilight world. Where others see only blackness, HABROK , shows the finest detail – sharp and bright with the clearest definition.,While conventional optics reduce the golden glow of sunset to murky greys, HABROK , reveals the great outdoors in all its glory, bringing it to life in vivid full color , UHD. Nothing goes unseen; the chestnut hue and fine texture of the deer's coat, the subtle twitch of foliage on the woodland edge, and the glint of the last fiery rays catching the buck's antlers as it pauses to sniff the cool evening air. Apart from serving as important signs for the distant hunter watching from the hill, these details add to the thrill of the hunt. Twilight is the canvas on which HABROK , works its magical artistry, immersing you in the beauty of nature and creating memories that will last a lifetime.,The fading light gives the buck confidence to venture from the cover of the woods. The hunter zooms in closer, tracking every cautious step as the deer leaves its woodland sanctuary to feed on the open field. Even at high (22x) magnification, HABROK 4K's advanced Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) keeps the view rock steady. The hunter's hands are trembling from the exertion of the climb and the excitement of encountering such a worthy adversary, yet the image is unfaltering. A distant target and thumping pulse make no difference, the view through HABROK , remains smooth and stable, leaving the hunter free from distraction and fully focused on the drama of the twilight hunt.,The buck moves behind a rocky outcrop, forcing the hunter to shift position to maintain visual contact. The HABROK , is light and compact, combining all viewing options in a single package. Free from the burden of carrying multiple optics, the hunter moves with ease to follow his quarry.,From a new vantage point, the hunter switches HABROK , from full-color 5.5-22x60 binocular to thermal viewing. The buck's heat profile stands out like a beacon and the hunt resumes.,Now the hunter switches HABROK , to night mode, utilizing its integral IR illuminator to banish the darkness. A pin-sharp monochrome image confirms that this is the beast the hunter wants. HABROK 4K's , built-in laser rangefinder reveals exact distance to target. The hunter takes aim and the twilight adventure comes to a successful conclusion as the moon rises over the wild landscape.,Twilight is the ultimate test in the hunt for the last five minutes, HABROK , has passed with flying colors.,The hunt reaches its most critical point during the magical moments between day and night. HABROK , becomes an essential tool for success in these vital final five minutes of daylight, buying the hunter valuable extra time when traditional binoculars are no longer of use.,With superior low-light performance, full-color , UHD imaging, and stability powered by advanced EIS technology, HABROK , continues to provide clear viewing in the fading light – when successful hunters need it most. Whether watching a buck as it creeps out from cover or tracking a deer moving swiftly across a twilight field, HABROK , ensures that no detail is missed. Own the hunt by entering the new season with the No.1 choice for all-day, all-light hunting excellence: HABROK ,.,HIKMICRO never stands still and works tirelessly to deliver the best digital and thermal hunting solutions on the market.,The next step in the journey of all-light domination is a , upgrade for the HABROK HQ35L 5.5-22x.

Apnimed will develop sulthiame with Shionogi & Co. Ltd. through their joint venture, Shionogi-Apnimed Sleep Science (SASS). Sulthiame is currently approved for non sleep-related diseases in several regions outside the US, and has completed successful Phase 2 trials for OSA in ,. Sulthiame has not yet been approved for any use in the US.,""This transaction represents an exciting opportunity to develop a promising new compound for OSA that is designed with a different mechanism of action from our lead program, AD109,"" commented ,, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Apnimed. ""Sulthiame's differentiated mechanistic design offers the potential to expand the reach of treatment and further accelerate the adoption of oral therapies for OSA."",""We look forward to adding another compelling asset to the SASS pipeline,"" added ,, Ph.D. SVP, R&D Supervisory Unit and Pharmaceutical Technology Research Division, Shionogi & Co. Ltd. ""Our Joint Venture, combining the scientific and medical resources of Apnimed and Shionogi, represents the most robust global effort to bring new oral, pharmacologic treatments to patients with OSA."",""Desitin is proud to have contributed to the ongoing clinical development of sulthiame, an investigational compound with compelling Phase 2 efficacy data and a favourable safety profile,"" said ,, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Desitin. ""Sulthiame is now in the best possible hands to successfully complete its development and bring benefits to patients with OSA and other sleep-related breathing indications around the world."",Under the terms of the agreement, Desitin will receive an undisclosed upfront payment, future milestone payments and royalties on future sales. As part of the transaction, SASS will also explore the use of sulthiame in additional sleep and breathing diseases including Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS).,Sulthiame is an investigational, generally well-tolerated oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is designed to restore breathing stability which is often a contributing mechanism in people with OSA. Sulthiame has successfully completed two Phase 2 trials in over 300 European OSA patients, studied for a duration of up to 3 months. It has been used clinically in non-sleep indications outside , and has demonstrated a favorable safety profile, to date.,Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious, chronic sleep-related breathing disease in which the upper airway repeatedly collapses during sleep, leading to intermittent oxygen deprivation. It can be caused by two overlapping mechanisms: neuromuscular dysfunction during sleep and predisposing anatomic abnormalities. It has been demonstrated that OSA can affect people of all weight classes, ages and genders —there is no single ""face"" of the disease.  An estimated 80 million people in , and 1 billion people worldwide suffer from OSA. ,An individual with OSA can experience hundreds of sleep apnea events in a single night, each one reducing the blood oxygen levels and negatively impacting cellular functions vital to normal health and function. Failure to effectively treat OSA increases the risk of serious long-term health consequences, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, along with impacts on quality of life, including daytime fatigue and cognitive function. The majority of those diagnosed with OSA refuse, abandon, or underutilize current treatment options. Currently, no available pharmacological treatments directly address the underlying neuromuscular dysfunction that is present in all people with OSA.,Shionogi-Apnimed Sleep Science (SASS) is a joint venture of Apnimed Inc. and Shionogi & Co., Ltd. focused on accelerating the discovery, preclinical and clinical development of novel pharmacologic solutions designed to address the complex pathology of sleep apnea and related diseases.,Apnimed is a privately held clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the treatment landscape for sleep-related breathing diseases. We believe the introduction of simple, once-nightly oral drugs has the potential to dramatically expand diagnosis and the reach of treatment for people with OSA. OSA, like other common chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension, would benefit from having multiple drugs with differing mechanisms to more fully address the heterogeneity of disease pathophysiology. Apnimed envisions a new era where novel oral therapies simplify intervention, expand the reach of diagnosis and treatment, and help more people get the oxygen and restorative sleep needed to thrive.,Based in ,, Apnimed is advancing a robust pipeline of oral pharmaceutical product candidates designed to improve oxygenation in individuals living with OSA and other sleep-related breathing disorders. Our lead candidate, AD109, could become the catalyst for a new oral treatment paradigm for OSA that has been historically limited to cumbersome devices or invasive surgeries. AD109 is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of mild, moderate and severe OSA. Apnimed is also developing several therapies as part of its joint venture with Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Shionogi-Apnimed Sleep Science.,AD109 is an investigational once-nightly oral pill that could become the first pharmacological treatment to improve oxygenation during sleep by directly targeting the underlying neuromuscular dysfunction that can cause the upper airway to collapse in people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It is a first-in-class investigational combination of , a novel antimuscarinic, and ,, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. These compounds are designed to work synergistically to target the neuromuscular root cause of OSA. In a disease characterized by complex and invasive treatment options, AD109 may offer a simple solution to help improve oxygenation and overall health and quality of life for people living with OSA. The AD109 Phase 3 clinical trial program is fully enrolled with topline results expected Q2 and Q3 2025.,Learn more at apnimed.com or follow us on , and ,.,SOURCE Apnimed, Inc."

В этом четырехдневном испытании приняли участие два гибридных автомобиля Chery, — TIGGO9 CSH и ARRIZO8 CSH — возглавляя автоколонну международных СМИ из Малайзии, Польши, Чехии и других стран. Старт испытаний был дан в Саньсе, маршрут проходил через Ухань и Учжэнь и завершился в Шанхае. Дальность поездки составила более 1 400 километров. Эти основательные испытания укрепили признание и одобрение гибридных автомобилей Chery во всем мире.,
              ,В ходе испытания, на всем протяжении более 1 400 килеметров, были использованы разные сценарии вождения — городские пробки, горные серпантины и езда на большой скорости. Преимущества технологии CSH воплощаются в реальность благодаря прорывам в фундаментальной архитектуре. Гибридный двигатель 1.5TGDI пятого поколения устанавливает новый стандарт, имея тепловой КПД 44,5 %. В сочетании с бесступенчатой электрической гибридной системой DHT, обладающей эффективностью передачи 98,5 %, он идеально уравновешивает мощность и эффективность. Эти инновации обеспечивают всестороннее лидерство в эффективности, как TIGGO9 CSH, так и ARRIZO8 CSH.,Испытание на выносливость «Endless Horizon Worry-Free Voyage» было сосредоточено на дальности хода автомобилей. Обе модели прошли более 1 400 километров, что свело на нет беспокойство по поводу дальности поездок. ARRIZO8 CSH установил рекорд по расходу топлива — всего 4,2 л/100 км в режиме разряда батареи, в то время как у TIGGO9 CSH, оснащенного гибридной батареей, быстрая зарядка (30 %– 80 %) заняла всего 20 минут. Кроме того, автомобиль оснащен функцией V2L 6,6 кВт, идеально подходящей для питания наружного оборудования во время туристических походов. Обе модели сохраняли скорость 120 км/ч на протяжении 600-километрового теста на высокой скорости, демонстрируя надежные силовые характеристики. Благодаря почти 20 функциям ADAS, APA и низкому уровню шума в салоне 60 дБА при 120 км/ч, они обеспечивают интеллектуальное, безопасное и комфортное вождение.,Мероприятие продемонстрировало не только технологические возможности бренда, но и стало воплощением философии «технологического равенства». После китайского этапа следующий раунд испытаний начнется с Малайзии. Впереди ещё более 40 тестов в реальных условиях в более чем 20 странах и регионах с участием большего количества моделей из линейки CSH. Цель — продемонстрировать адаптивность системы «all-scenario, worry-free» (все сценарии, без проблем) в различных условиях.,Фото - "

(NYSE: ,), offered a revealing look into how the Chinese beauty tech company is evolving from a trend-savvy startup into a global innovation leader.,From a growing portfolio of brands to deep investments in science and R&D, Huang positioned Yatsen as a rare hybrid—both agile and deeply rooted in long-term thinking. His message was clear: beauty is being redefined, and Yatsen intends to lead the next era.,
              
            ,Founded in 2016, Yatsen first captured attention through Perfect Diary, now a mainstream brand in ,. Since then, the company has expanded to 11 brands, spanning mass, masstige, and premium tiers.,Its lineup includes , Galenic, focused on cellular anti-aging, the sensorial British skincare brand ,, and dermatologist-backed Dr.Wu. Together, these brands reflect a deliberate strategy: address varied consumer needs with credible, differentiated propositions.,""Our vision was always to build a next-generation beauty tech company,"" Huang explained. ""From trend-driven to science-backed, we now offer products across all major segments—what unites them is innovation."",The domestic beauty market in , is vast—valued at over , billion—yet remains fragmented. Even the top players only command single-digit market shares, giving agile innovators room to grow.,Despite recent macro challenges, Huang is confident: ""Chinese consumers are still highly willing to pay—as long as the product truly delivers."",That belief led to one of Yatsen's breakout hits: the Biolip Essence Lipstick. Priced similarly to global luxury brands, this hybrid product combines high-performance color with skincare benefits, including patented ingredients that stimulate collagen and reduce lip wrinkles.,""It's not just makeup. It's biotech in a lipstick,"" Huang said. ""And the market responded—we've seen strong repurchase and loyalty."",Yatsen's transformation goes beyond branding. In 2021, the company initiated a strategic shift: lean harder into skincare, R&D, and innovation-led premiumization. The move was both ambitious and risky, as it involved restructuring operations, reallocating capital, and riding out a tough market cycle.,""Turning around a public company isn't easy,"" said Huang. ""But we knew where the market was going—toward science-backed, benefit-driven beauty. We invested over , in R&D, filed 240+ patents, and published in top-tier journals like , and ,."",He added that 3% of Yatsen's revenue is now allocated to R&D—putting the company among global leaders in innovation spend ratio in the beauty category.,While Yatsen's stock price has yet to return to IPO levels, Huang emphasized the fundamentals are stronger than ever.,""Since last quarter, investor feedback has been increasingly positive. But more important than sentiment is performance—we've resumed profitable growth, with a long-term focus on value creation,"" he said.,The turnaround, built on disciplined brand building and product innovation, has earned Yatsen growing respect among long-term investors.,""We believe the equity market is a weighing machine over time. Our job is to do the right things—R&D, great products, strong brands—and the value will follow."",Huang also addressed concerns around trade and supply chain disruptions, particularly in light of global tariff tensions.,While the beauty industry is highly globalized, Yatsen has insulated itself well. Most of its components and ingredients are sourced domestically, and its primary market remains mainland China.,""We're not immune, but we're well-positioned,"" he said. ""We monitor risks—supplier stability, cross-border issues—but our current exposure is manageable. Still, we stay agile."",When asked whether cost increases from potential tariffs would be passed on to consumers, Huang pointed to the brand's focus on delivering value, not just price.,""Consumers are smart. Post-COVID, they're more price-sensitive, but they're not chasing the lowest price. They want high value—products that justify their cost."",Huang believes that Yatsen's unique blend of local insight and global scientific ambition sets it apart from multinationals struggling to regain ground in ,.,""We're not just following trends—we're deeply embedded in where Chinese consumer preferences are heading,"" he said. ""Biotech, neuroscience, ingredient innovation—this is where we're , big."",Yatsen is already seeing results from this strategy with loyal followings for products under brands like Galenic and high-performance serums featuring vitamin A and C.,In a nod to its future direction, Huang revealed that Yatsen is now exploring neuroscience applications in skincare—a niche with massive long-term potential.,On the capital markets front, Huang acknowledged investor concerns around ADR delistings ,. But Yatsen is taking a disciplined, transparent approach.,The company completed a , share buyback, reinforcing confidence and alignment with shareholders.,Yatsen represents a rare blend of scale, agility, and innovation depth. With proven market traction, a science-led product pipeline, and a profitable operating model, the company is positioned to capture long-term share in a fragmented, fast-evolving industry. In terms of ,'s vision,  ""We're not just making beauty products,"" Huang concluded, ""We're inventing the future of beauty—and we're just getting started."",SOURCE Yatsen Holding Limited"

As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of the Company's businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by the Company's capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and the cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures.     ,Free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.   ,Management and Charter's board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to assess Charter's performance and its ability to service its debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under the Company's credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the SEC). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by its operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities.

The strategies include leveraged and inverse ETFs that seek short or long exposure to actively traded stocks and ETFs.,IMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION,Tradr ETFs are for sophisticated investors and professional traders with high conviction views and are very different from most other ETFs. The Funds are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles and pursue leveraged investment objectives, which means they are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the Funds magnify the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Fund's return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security.,Investors in the fund should: (a) understand the risks associated with the use of leverage; (b) understand the consequences of seeking inverse and leveraged investment results; (c) for short ETFs, understand the risk of shorting; (d) intend to actively monitor and manage their investment. Fund performance will likely be significantly different than the benchmark over periods longer than the specified reset period and the performance may trend in the opposite direction than its benchmark over periods other than that period.,Leverage increases the risk of a total loss of an investor's investment, may increase the volatility of the Funds, and may magnify any differences between the performance of the Funds and their reference security. The Funds seek leveraged investment results for a specific period (daily, monthly or quarterly). The exact exposure of an investment in the Fund intra-period will depend upon the movement of the reference security from the end of the prior period until the time of investment by the investor.,ETFs involve risk including possible loss of the full principal value. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Principal risks and other important risks may be found in the prospectus. Past performance does not guarantee future results.,ETF shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns.,Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds. This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the Prospectus, which can be obtained by visiting ,.

We reduced operating expenses and are on pace to meet our , cost savings goal, reduced our credit costs as both the provision for credit losses and net charge-offs declined, our net interest margin was stable compared to the fourth quarter, we continued to reduce our multi-family and commercial real estate portfolios, and made further progress in our C&I business, adding additional talent and originating nearly , in new loans, up over 40% compared to what we originated in the fourth quarter. More importantly, we grew C&I loans in our focus areas by over 4% compared to last quarter.,""During the quarter, we added 15 talented bankers in our commercial lending business bringing the total to 75 since we started expanding this business, and we plan to add another 80 to 90 bankers during the remainder of 2025. Additionally, we announced the hiring of Mark Pittsey to lead our Private Bank and Wealth Management businesses. Mark's extensive background will help drive continued growth in these two core business lines.,""On the credit quality front, criticized loans declined 6% compared to the prior quarter, and although we had a pick-up in non-accrual loans, this was largely due to one credit relationship. Our total allowance for credit losses was 1.82%, virtually unchanged from the previous quarter, while reserve coverage on multi-family loans with rent-regulated units at 50% or more of the total units was 2.82%.,""The significant strides we made in 2024 have laid the groundwork for growth and have established a path to profitability by fourth quarter 2025. While the near-term macro environment is filled with some uncertainties, I remain confident in our ability to execute on our strategic plan and to transform the Company into a high-performing, top-tier regional bank.,""Lastly, I would like to especially thank all of our teammates whose dedication and commitment to the organization and its customers has been unmatched."",At March 31, 2025, total assets were ,, down , or 3% versus December 31, 2024. The linked-quarter decline was driven by a decrease in total loans and leases held for investment (""HFI"") as the Company continues to reduce its commercial real estate (""CRE"") exposure, along with a decrease in cash balances.  During the first quarter 2025, we re-deployed some of our liquidity into available-for-sale (""AFS"") investment securities. Accordingly, AFS investment securities rose , or 23% to , on a linked-quarter basis.,Total loans and leases held for investment at March 31, 2025 were ,, down , or 2% on a linked-quarter basis. The multi-family loan portfolio declined , or 2% to , on a linked-quarter basis while the CRE portfolio decreased , or 3% on a linked-quarter basis to ,. The linked-quarter decrease was the result of exiting non-relationship borrowers, par payoffs, and loan sales, at or close to current valuations, that were previously disclosed during the fourth quarter of 2024. The declines in both of these portfolios is a continuation of the Company's overall strategy to diversify the loan portfolio by reducing its multi-family and CRE exposure.,Total commercial and industrial (""C&I"") loans declined , or 4% to , on a linked-quarter basis. The linked-quarter decrease is due to the Company's strategy to reduce non-core loans within the specialty finance and leasing portfolios, as well as reducing exposures in the MSR lending business. ,We experienced another strong quarter of production from our new C&I lending teams. During first quarter 2025, new credit commitments totaled , of which we funded , compared to , and ,, respectively, in fourth quarter 2024.,Total deposits at March 31, 2025 were ,, a , or 3% linked-quarter decrease. The linked-quarter decline was driven by the sale of our mortgage servicing/sub-servicing and third-party origination business during the fourth quarter of 2024, which included the transfer of mortgage escrow deposits to the buyer. Non-interest-bearing deposits declined , or 5% on a linked-quarter basis due to the sale of the mortgage servicing business.,Certificates of deposit (""CDs"") decreased , or 5% to , on a linked-quarter basis. The linked-quarter decline was driven by a decrease in brokered CDs, reflecting our strategy to reduce higher cost funding. During the first quarter, the Company paid off approximately , in brokered CDs.,At March 31, 2025, wholesale borrowings totaled ,, down , or 2% on a linked-quarter basis. After rebuilding our liquidity position over the course of 2024 through deposit growth and asset sales, we paid down wholesale borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of , (""FHLB-NY"") advances, in the second half of 2024. In first quarter 2025, we paid off , of FHLB-NY advances.,First quarter 2025 results included two notable items. These items include , in lease cost acceleration related to our previously announced branch closures and , in trailing costs related to the sale of our mortgage servicing/sub-servicing and third-party origination business during the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, the Company also incurred , of merger-related expenses during the quarter. As adjusted for these items, the net loss for first quarter 2025 was , and the net loss attributable to common stockholders was , or , per diluted share. This compares to a fourth quarter 2024 net loss, as adjusted for merger-related expenses and for certain items related to the sale of the servicing/sub-servicing and third-party origination business, severance costs, and long-term asset impairment charges related to various Company-owned or leased properties, of , and a net loss attributable to common stockholders of , or , per diluted share. First quarter 2024, net loss and net loss attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted for merger-related and restructuring expenses and the bargain purchase gain, was , and , or , per diluted share, respectively.,Net interest income for the first quarter 2025 totaled $410 million, down $51 million, or 11%, compared to fourth quarter 2024. The linked-quarter decline was driven by a smaller balance sheet partially offset by lower funding costs. Average loan balances decreased over the past five quarters due to several strategic actions that began during early 2024, including the sale of our mortgage warehouse business and mortgage servicing/sub-servicing and third-party origination business, a strategic reduction in the multi-family and commercial real estate portfolios from a combination of par payoffs and strategic loan sales, and lower net C&I balances as our growth was outpaced by the pay-down of certain non-core, non-strategic relationships. During first-quarter 2025, we utilized a portion of our cash position to purchase higher yielding investment securities. The decrease in average loan balances was partially offset by a lower level of average borrowed funds, as the Company paid off a substantial amount of wholesale borrowings, primarily FHLB-NY advances during 2024.  ,During first quarter 2025, we stabilized the net interest margin (""NIM"") as compared to fourth-quarter 2024. First-quarter 2025 NIM was 1.74%, up 1 basis point compared to fourth quarter 2024, but down 54 basis points compared to first quarter 2024. The linked-quarter improvement was driven by a 25 basis point decrease in the cost of average total interest-bearing liabilities to 4.02% partially offset by a 21 basis point decrease in the average total interest-earnings assets. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits dropped 34 basis points to 3.85% reflecting a decline in market rates, along with a , or 6% decrease in average interest-bearing deposits to ,. Additionally, average borrowed funds declined , or 20% to ,, while their cost increased 15 basis points to 4.71%.,Average loan balances declined , or 5% to , on a linked-quarter basis, while the average loan yield also declined 22 basis points to 5.06%. Average cash balances declined , or 35% to , as we used a portion of our cash to purchase investment securities and pay down wholesale borrowings. Average investment securities rose modestly, up , or 5.83% to ,.,The year-over-year decline in the NIM was due to several factors including lower average total interest-earnings assets due to our strategic actions to sell certain businesses and reduce our commercial real estate concentrations, offset partially by a reduction in average wholesale borrowings, as well as lower overall market interest rates. The average yield on interest-earnings assets declined 61 basis points on a year-over-year basis, while average balances declined , or 13%. This was only partially offset by a 17 basis point decrease in the average cost interest-bearing liabilities, while these average balances decreased , or 11%.,Year-over-year, average loan balances declined , or 19%, while the average loan yield dropped 62 basis points. Average securities balances increased , or 13% along with a corresponding 29 basis point increase in the average yield. This was offset in part by an , or 44% decrease in average borrowings, along with a 28 basis point decrease in the average cost of borrowings. Average deposit balances rose , or 4% on a year-over-year basis, while the average cost of deposits remained unchanged.,For the three months ended ,, the provision for credit losses decreased , compared to the three months ended ,. This decrease is primarily due to lower net charge-offs, our continued focus on credit reviews, and the receipt of recent appraisals. Additionally, our ACL balance decreased since December 31, 2024, as result of the on-going strategic reduction of our multi-family, CRE and non-core C&I portfolios. The reduction in our ACL balance was partially offset by the negatively trending macro-economic environment.,Net charge-offs for the first quarter 2025 totaled ,, down , or 48% compared to fourth quarter 2024, but were up , or 42% compared to first quarter 2024. Net charge-offs on an annualized basis represented 0.68% of average loans outstanding, compared to 1.23% of fourth quarter 2024 and compared to 0.39% during first quarter 2024. ,The table below details the Company's PPNR and related measures, which are non-GAAP measures, for the periods noted:,For the first quarter 2025, pre-provision net loss totaled $42 million compared to a pre-provision net loss of , for fourth quarter 2024 and a pre-provision net loss of , for first quarter 2024. First quarter 2025 pre-provision net loss included two notable items including $6 million related to lease cost accelerated related to branch closures and $5 million in trailing costs related to the sale of the mortgage servicing/sub-servicing and third-party originations business. As adjusted for these items and for merger-related expenses, the first quarter pre-provision net loss improved to $23 million compared to a pre-provision net loss of , for fourth quarter 2024 and pre-provision net revenue of , for first quarter 2024.,In first quarter 2025, non-interest income totaled $80 million compared to $164 million in fourth quarter 2024 and , in first quarter 2024. Included in fourth quarter 2024 non-interest income was a $89 million gain on the sale of our mortgage servicing/sub-servicing and third-party origination business, while first quarter 2024 non-interest income included a bargain purchase gain of $121 million. As adjusted for these items, first quarter 2025 non-interest income increased $8 million or 11% from , in fourth quarter 2024, but declined $50 million or 38% from , in first-quarter 2024.,The linked-quarter increase was primarily due to higher net gain on loan sales and securitizations, up $8 million to $13 million and higher other income, up , or 7%, partially offset by lower fee income, down $11 million or 33%. The year-over-year decline was due to lower fee income, down $12 million or 35%, lower net gain on loan sales and securitizations, down $7 million or 35%, and lower net loan administration income, down $12 million or 75%; partially offset by a , or 7% increase in other income. Both the linked-quarter and year-over-year declines in our net return on mortgage servicing rights and net loan administration income are due to the sale of our mortgage servicing/sub-servicing and third-party origination business during fourth quarter 2024.,First quarter 2025 non-interest expense totaled $532 million, down $186 million or 26% on a linked-quarter basis and down $167 million or 24% on a year-over-year basis. Both first quarter 2025 and fourth-quarter 2024 included a number notable items compared to no such items in first-quarter 2024. Fourth-quarter 2024 included $31 million of severance costs, $77 million of long-term asset impairment costs, and $12 million of costs related to the sale of the mortgage servicing/sub-servicing business. First quarter 2025 included $6 million of lease cost acceleration related to branch closures and $5 million in trailing costs related to the sale of the mortgage servicing/sub-servicing business.,As adjusted for these items and excluding intangible asset amortization and merger-related expenses, first quarter 2025 non-interest expenses totaled $485 million, down $71 million or 13% on a linked-quarter basis and down $136 million or 22% on a year-over-year basis. The linked-quarter decreases were driven by a $27 million or 10% decline in compensation and benefits expense, a $24 million or 32% decrease in FDIC insurance expense, and a $21 million or 13% decline in general and administrative expenses. The year-over-year decline was the result of an $89 million or 27% decrease in compensation and benefits expense and a $44 million or 24% decline in general and administrative expenses.,For the first quarter 2025, the Company reported a benefit for income taxes of $21 million compared to a benefit for income taxes of $50 million for the fourth quarter 2024 and a benefit of , for the three months ended ,, 2024.  The effective tax rate for the first quarter 2025 was 17.82% compared to 21.32% for the fourth quarter 2024, and 14.32% for the three months ended ,.,At March 31, 2025, total non-accrual loans, including held-for-sale, were ,, up , or 12% compared to December 31, 2024. The linked-quarter increase was primarily due to higher non-accrual multi-family loans and a majority of this increase was tied to one borrower relationship. Excluding this relationship, total non-accrual loans would have decreased , or 1.3%. The year-over-year increase was driven by increased multi-family and commercial real estate, mostly office-related, non-accruals, as the Company proactively dealt with potential credit issues throughout 2024.,Total non-accrual loans HFI to total loans HFI were 4.9% at March 31, 2025 compared to 3.8% at December 31, 2024 and 0.97% at March 31, 2024.,The total allowance for credit losses was , at March 31, 2025 compared to ,,251 million at December 31, 2024 and , at March 31, 2024.

the impact of any regulatory investigations brought in ,, the U.K., the U.S. and other countries; failure to protect intellectual property rights or allegations that Aon infringes on the intellectual property rights of others;

The factors identified above are not exhaustive. Aon and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. In addition, results for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any future period. Further information concerning Aon and its businesses, including factors that could materially affect Aon's financial results, is contained in Aon's filings with the SEC. , Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended , for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to Aon and its businesses. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Aon is not under, and expressly disclaims, any obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise,This communication includes supplemental information not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in , (""U.S. GAAP""), including Organic revenue growth, free cash flow, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted net income attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted diluted net income per share, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted other income (expense), and adjusted income before income taxes that exclude the effects of intangible asset amortization and impairment, Accelerating Aon United Program expenses, contingent consideration, NFP transaction and integration costs, certain pension settlements, capital expenditures, and certain other noteworthy items that affected results for the comparable periods, and leverage ratio. Organic revenue growth includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions (provided that Organic revenue growth includes Organic growth of an acquired business as calculated assuming that the acquired business was part of the combined company for the same proportion of the relevant prior year period), divestitures (including held for sale disposal groups, if any), transfers between revenue lines, fiduciary investment income, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. Currency impact represents the effect on prior year period results if they were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Reconciliations to the closest U.S. GAAP measure for each non-GAAP measure presented in this communication are provided in the attached appendices. Supplemental Organic revenue growth information and additional measures that exclude the effects of certain items noted above do not affect net income or any other U.S. GAAP reported amounts. Free cash flow is cash flows from operating activity less capital expenditures. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the applicable tax impact associated with adjustments previously described, generally at the estimated annual effective tax rate or jurisdictional rate, where appropriate. Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, the adjusted effective tax rate also excludes interest accruals for income tax reserves related to the termination fee payment made in connection with the Company's terminated proposed combination with ,. Leverage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt by trailing 12-month EBITDA. EBITDA is net income minus the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Management also uses these measures to assess operating performance and performance for compensation. Non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, Aon's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. Aon does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, such as leverage ratio, where Aon believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be misleading and is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the corresponding GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred and are out of the Aon's control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For these reasons, Aon is also unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information., ,SOURCE Aon plc"

Amid intensifying U.S.–China tariff tensions and persistent inflation concerns, people are increasingly moving their money away from abstract financial instruments and into real, essential commodities — like liquor and rice — not just as items of consumption, but as stable, long-term stores of value.,""During times like these, we're seeing more people step away from over-financialized, virtual instruments and shift toward things that have everyday value,"" said ,, Director of Public Relations, , at AIFIAN. ""It's not just about financial growth anymore — it's about holding onto something that's useful, needed, and real."",Traditional tools like stocks, bonds, and , are all facing growing challenges. Stocks have become highly volatile, driven more by speculation than fundamentals. Bonds, which once offered stability, now struggle to keep up with inflation. , are facing regulatory uncertainty and liquidity issues.,According to a recent article from Forbes Finance Council, 2024 saw several rare moments where both stocks and bonds declined at the same time — a situation known as a ""dual drawdown."" These events highlight the risks of relying solely on virtual or paper-based holdings.,By contrast, tangible goods — especially those from primary industries like agriculture, forestry, and fisheries — offer both practicality and long-term dependability. These are things people eat, drink, build with, or store — not abstract assets, but real-world necessities with consistent demand.,""At AIFIAN, we help people access and store everyday essentials that come from real industries,"" Chang explained.,AIFIAN's platform makes it easy for users to purchase, store, and monitor these goods without worrying about logistics. Liquor, in particular, has become a popular option due to its stable demand and ease of storage. The platform also provides a global interface where users can transfer ownership when needed, offering flexibility in how these materials are used.,With recent tariff shifts, many users have begun allocating more of their spending toward tangible items like liquor and agricultural products. This trend is especially pronounced among younger generations. According to Crain Currency, many Millennials and Gen Z consumers are increasingly turning to wine and spirits — not just for drinking, but as investment assets.,As traditional financial systems feel out of sync with their values or budgets, younger investors are turning to tangible alternatives that reflect both cultural relevance and potential long-term returns. This generational shift aligns with AIFIAN's mission to make real-world asset ownership accessible, familiar, and future-proof.,About AIFIAN,AIFIAN is a U.S.-based retail platform helping over 700,000 users worldwide purchase, store, and manage essential physical goods—such as alcohol, agricultural commodities, and long-term consumables—from trusted sources in primary industries.,SOURCE AIFIAN LIMITED"

""We are laying the foundation for solid results, diligent cost management and strong execution in 2025 and beyond."",Total revenues increased due to demand growth from semiconductor manufacturing and technology infrastructure customers, partially offset by lower average price of deliveries from changing delivery mix. Purchased power and fuel expense decreased due to decreased prices for purchased power and fuel. Operating and maintenance and administrative expenses increased due to wildfire mitigation, vegetation management, service restoration work, wages and benefits, and professional services costs. Depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense increased due to ongoing capital investment. Income tax expense increased as a result of lower production tax credit generation.,The Constable, Sundial and Coffee Creek battery storage systems, a combined 292 MW of energy storage capacity,  completed the first full quarter of service in Q1 2025. Including the incoming 200 MW Seaside battery, which is estimated to be in-service in mid-2025, PGE will soon have over 500 MW of total battery storage, providing a vital tool for renewable integration, system reliability and energy price management.,In March, PGE released its 2024 Environmental, Social and Governance Report, which details key accomplishments including large customer participation in voluntary clean energy programs, record fish returns at hydro facilities and increases in employee volunteerism. The report highlights record clean energy performance in 2024, with non-emitting resources making up 45% of PGE's energy mix.

Management will respond to questions following formal comments.,The attached unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, balance sheets and statements of cash flows, as well as the supplemental operating statistics, are an integral part of this earnings release.,This press release contains certain non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted earnings guidance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant items that are generally not related to our ongoing business activities, are infrequent in nature, or both. PGE believes that excluding the effects of these items provides a meaningful representation of the Company's comparative earnings per share and enables investors to evaluate the Company's ongoing operating financial performance. Management utilizes non-GAAP measures to assess the Company's current and forecasted performance, and for communications with shareholders, analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplementary information that should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP.,Items in the periods presented, which PGE believes impact the comparability of comparative earnings and do not represent ongoing operating financial performance, include the following:,Due to the forward-looking nature of PGE's non-GAAP adjusted earnings guidance, and the inherently unpredictable nature of items and events which could lead to the recognition of non-GAAP adjustments (such as, but not limited to, regulatory disallowances or extreme weather events), management is unable to estimate the occurrence or value of specific items requiring adjustment for future periods, which could potentially impact the Company's GAAP earnings. Therefore, management cannot provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share guidance to the most comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable effort. For the same reasons, management is unable to address the probable significance of unavailable information.,PGE's reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings for the quarter ended , is below.,Portland General Electric (NYSE: ,) is an integrated energy company that generates, transmits and distributes electricity to over 950,000 customers serving an area of 1.9 million Oregonians.

The lower volumes were partly offset by a solid price/mix. Demand in , remained weak. However, we view the announced state-backed investments aimed at increasing European competitiveness as positive long term. , and , posted positive organic growth for the first time in seven quarters, primarily driven by favorable comparable figures. Both Americas and , and , shifted from organic growth in Q4 to a decline in Q1. This was mainly due to the positive timing effects at the end of 2024 as previously communicated and a weaker automotive demand.,The adjusted operating margin was strong at 13.5%, a slight year-over-year improvement despite a weak market environment. The margin resilience was supported by an effective execution of pricing, portfolio management, and cost reduction initiatives. However, these initiatives did not fully offset the negative impact from lower volumes. Currency effects had a positive impact on the margin, mainly driven by a stronger USD year-over-year.,The adjusted operating margin for our Industrial business increased to 16.9%, driven by good portfolio and cost management execution. The Automotive business performed relatively well, considering the challenging market conditions, with an adjusted operating margin of 5.2%. We see potential in further improving the margin, but given the current turbulent environment, the timeline of achieving the targeted 8% adjusted operating margin level will extend beyond 2025.,Cash flow was not satisfactory at close to BSEK 1, mainly driven by increased working capital, including high accounts receivables generated by a strong quarter end, and negative currency effects.,The separation of the Automotive business continues at high pace, where the operating model and organizational design now have been concluded. Automotive's global manufacturing footprint has also been finalized with 16 factories. The overall separation process progresses according to plan, but the complexity of the separation, including the IT structure, may stretch the overall time plan.,The initiated organizational review is progressing well, rightsizing both organizations to create strong foundations for the future and to withstand turbulent markets. More focused businesses with less complexity allow for leaner organizational structures resulting in sizeable reductions in staff positions, not least within ,. The number of positions affected, savings and restructuring charge will be presented in conjunction with the Q2 2025 report.,Lately, the business environment has experienced significant volatility driven by increased geopolitical uncertainty including trade and tariff turmoil. We are preparing the business for different scenarios and remain confident that our strategy, in combination with our decentralized organization and effective cost management, will provide us with the agility and flexibility to navigate through these turbulent times. So far, we have largely compensated for increased tariff costs through price adjustments and we expect to continue to do so also in the second quarter, given current tariff levels. However, today's market uncertainty may influence demand and the prerequisites for certain products and markets.,We expect continued volatility and, even if we have seen signs of markets bottoming out, we plan for another quarter with negative volumes and expect organic sales to weaken somewhat in Q2, year-over-year."",           ,           ,          ,: +46 (0)8 5051 0031,UK/International: +44 (0)207 107 0613,Aktiebolaget SKF,      (publ),Press Relations: Carl Bjernstam, +46 31-337 2517; +46 722 201 893; , ,Investor Relations: Sophie Arnius, +46 31-337 8072; +46 705 908072; , ,This information was brought to you by Cision ,The following files are available for download:"

A majority of this is expected in Q2/2025.,The Group's capital expenditure forecast for the full year of 2025 is EUR 730–790 million.,In the second quarter of 2025, maintenance costs are expected to increase by approximately , from Q1/2025. ,Fiber costs are expected to remain at high levels.,In the Packaging Materials division, the containerboard market is expected to remain stable with ongoing price increases. Consumer board demand is expected to be seasonally stronger, and products from Stora Enso's new consumer packaging board line will gradually increase delivery volumes.,The Packaging Solutions division anticipates increased demand in , due to the seasonal fruit and vegetable market, while expectations for Asian demand suggest a return to lower seasonal norms.,The Biomaterials division predicts stable demand with higher prices driven by a tightening supply, partly offset by weaker USD.,For Wood Products, no structural demand improvement is expected, though seasonal factors and continued cost mitigation is expected to provide support.,The Forest division is expected to maintain robust financial performance.,During the first quarter of 2025, we continued to make good progress in building a stronger and more profitable Stora Enso. We recorded a robust adjusted EBIT of ,, an 18% increase year-on-year, with an EBIT margin of 7.4%. This improvement primarily resulted from higher prices, alongside increased volumes, favourable foreign exchange rates, and the positive impact of cost-saving and value-creation initiatives, which helped mitigate continued high fiber costs. ,This marks the fourth consecutive quarter with a year-on-year result improvement. Furthermore, in the first quarter, all divisions achieved positive adjusted EBIT for the first time since the third quarter of 2022. Group sales rose by 9% year-on-year, driven by higher deliveries and increased sales prices across most divisions. ,In our Packaging Materials division, we saw a slight recovery in demand, albeit at low levels, particularly in ,, where higher prices contributed positively. Our Packaging Solutions division also delivered increased sales and EBIT driven by larger volumes, but with price pressure caused by market overcapacity somewhat offsetting the positive volume impact. ,Our Biomaterials division delivered stable results through higher volumes despite headwinds with lower pulp prices and volumes, along with higher variable costs both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. The Wood Products division reached a break-even adjusted EBIT. This progress was driven by strong efficiency improvement actions coupled with somewhat improved demand, while still from a low level due to a continued weak construction market. In our Forest division, the high demand and tight markets for wood and fresh fiber continued, leading to another record-high quarterly EBIT. ,Overall, the markets remain volatile, with low consumer sentiment further fuelled by tariff announcements. What comes to US tariffs, we estimate that the direct impact at current tariff rates is limited given that our direct sales to the , account for only just below 3% of total group sales (2024).

A majority of this is expected in Q2/2025.,The Group's capital expenditure forecast for the full year of 2025 is EUR 730–790 million.,In the second quarter of 2025, maintenance costs are expected to increase by approximately , from Q1/2025. ,Fiber costs are expected to remain at high levels.,In the Packaging Materials division, the containerboard market is expected to remain stable with ongoing price increases. Consumer board demand is expected to be seasonally stronger, and products from Stora Enso's new consumer packaging board line will gradually increase delivery volumes.,The Packaging Solutions division anticipates increased demand in , due to the seasonal fruit and vegetable market, while expectations for Asian demand suggest a return to lower seasonal norms.,The Biomaterials division predicts stable demand with higher prices driven by a tightening supply, partly offset by weaker USD.,For Wood Products, no structural demand improvement is expected, though seasonal factors and continued cost mitigation is expected to provide support.,The Forest division is expected to maintain robust financial performance.,During the first quarter of 2025, we continued to make good progress in building a stronger and more profitable Stora Enso. We recorded a robust adjusted EBIT of ,, an 18% increase year-on-year, with an EBIT margin of 7.4%. This improvement primarily resulted from higher prices, alongside increased volumes, favourable foreign exchange rates, and the positive impact of cost-saving and value-creation initiatives, which helped mitigate continued high fiber costs. ,This marks the fourth consecutive quarter with a year-on-year result improvement. Furthermore, in the first quarter, all divisions achieved positive adjusted EBIT for the first time since the third quarter of 2022. Group sales rose by 9% year-on-year, driven by higher deliveries and increased sales prices across most divisions. ,In our Packaging Materials division, we saw a slight recovery in demand, albeit at low levels, particularly in ,, where higher prices contributed positively. Our Packaging Solutions division also delivered increased sales and EBIT driven by larger volumes, but with price pressure caused by market overcapacity somewhat offsetting the positive volume impact. ,Our Biomaterials division delivered stable results through higher volumes despite headwinds with lower pulp prices and volumes, along with higher variable costs both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. The Wood Products division reached a break-even adjusted EBIT. This progress was driven by strong efficiency improvement actions coupled with somewhat improved demand, while still from a low level due to a continued weak construction market. In our Forest division, the high demand and tight markets for wood and fresh fiber continued, leading to another record-high quarterly EBIT. ,Overall, the markets remain volatile, with low consumer sentiment further fuelled by tariff announcements. What comes to US tariffs, we estimate that the direct impact at current tariff rates is limited given that our direct sales to the , account for only just below 3% of total group sales (2024). Tariffs impacting global trade present both risks and opportunities to our business.

The lower volumes were partly offset by a solid price/mix. Demand in , remained weak. However, we view the announced state-backed investments aimed at increasing European competitiveness as positive long term. , and , posted positive organic growth for the first time in seven quarters, primarily driven by favorable comparable figures. Both Americas and , and , shifted from organic growth in Q4 to a decline in Q1. This was mainly due to the positive timing effects at the end of 2024 as previously communicated and a weaker automotive demand.,The adjusted operating margin was strong at 13.5%, a slight year-over-year improvement despite a weak market environment. The margin resilience was supported by an effective execution of pricing, portfolio management, and cost reduction initiatives. However, these initiatives did not fully offset the negative impact from lower volumes. Currency effects had a positive impact on the margin, mainly driven by a stronger USD year-over-year.,The adjusted operating margin for our Industrial business increased to 16.9%, driven by good portfolio and cost management execution. The Automotive business performed relatively well, considering the challenging market conditions, with an adjusted operating margin of 5.2%. We see potential in further improving the margin, but given the current turbulent environment, the timeline of achieving the targeted 8% adjusted operating margin level will extend beyond 2025.,Cash flow was not satisfactory at close to BSEK 1, mainly driven by increased working capital, including high accounts receivables generated by a strong quarter end, and negative currency effects.,The separation of the Automotive business continues at high pace, where the operating model and organizational design now have been concluded. Automotive's global manufacturing footprint has also been finalized with 16 factories. The overall separation process progresses according to plan, but the complexity of the separation, including the IT structure, may stretch the overall time plan.,The initiated organizational review is progressing well, rightsizing both organizations to create strong foundations for the future and to withstand turbulent markets. More focused businesses with less complexity allow for leaner organizational structures resulting in sizeable reductions in staff positions, not least within ,. The number of positions affected, savings and restructuring charge will be presented in conjunction with the Q2 2025 report.,Lately, the business environment has experienced significant volatility driven by increased geopolitical uncertainty including trade and tariff turmoil. We are preparing the business for different scenarios and remain confident that our strategy, in combination with our , organization and effective cost management, will provide us with the agility and flexibility to navigate through these turbulent times. So far, we have largely compensated for increased tariff costs through price adjustments and we expect to continue to do so also in the second quarter, given current tariff levels. However, today's market uncertainty may influence demand and the prerequisites for certain products and markets.,We expect continued volatility and, even if we have seen signs of markets bottoming out, we plan for another quarter with negative volumes and expect organic sales to weaken somewhat in Q2, year-over-year."",           ,           ,          ,: +46 (0)8 5051 0031,UK/International: +44 (0)207 107 0613,Aktiebolaget SKF,      (publ),Press Relations: Carl Bjernstam, +46 31-337 2517; +46 722 201 893; , ,Investor Relations: Sophie Arnius, +46 31-337 8072; +46 705 908072; , ,This information was brought to you by Cision ,The following files are available for download:,SOURCE SKF"

Amongst such a backdrop, 29 countries and regions from , and , initiated, convened, and attended the Bandung Conference. This conference and the Bandung Spirit which arose from it, signify the awakening of the Third World in political awareness. Asian and African countries who uphold nationalism stepped onto the international stage with an independent stance, and hand-in-hand, they started the chapter of South-South Cooperation.,For 70 years, although there have been problems and tensions among the Global South countries, the major trend continues to be negotiations on equal stances, mutual help and unity in strength. From the Non-Aligned Movement and the G-77 in the 20th century, which respectively opposed camp confrontation and appealed to a new global economic order, to the rise of platforms including BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in the 21st century, the Global South countries have constantly voiced their collective concerns, and have become a force not to be neglected in the international arena. They are a driver of inclusive economic globalization, a builder of equal and orderly multi-polarization, and a proactive leader of mutual learning and communication among civilizations.

Are we still able to safeguard a fair international order with joined hands? Are we developing countries still treating each other with an inclusive and open mindset where we seek common ground while shelving differences?,70 years ago, the Asian and African countries reached a consensus on independence and common development despite their different ideologies and social systems. 70 years later, with the pressure of development, countries all over the world can also think about how to forge new consensus amongst differences, and form institutional connections in negotiations. The Bandung Spirit has long transcended the framework of ,-, cooperation and South-South Cooperation; it has in fact provided a timeless example for South-North cooperation and even global governance.,The dynamism of current changes in the world originates from the South.

Together, they aim to advance scalability, explainability, and safety through a hybrid architecture that combines data-centric AI approaches with the best practices in robotics, while also unlocking the potential of embodied AI to improve transparency and traceability in decision-making.,
              ,This collaboration is further strengthened through ,, the US Department of Transportation's , Transportation Center for Safety, led by CMU Professor Raj Rajkumar. TIER IV has joined Safety21's Advisory Council, promoting the value of open-source software through Autoware*, that addresses the trade-offs between safety and user experience in autonomous driving systems.,Traditional Level 4 autonomy has been built on robotics methods such as probabilistic estimation and machine learning, relying on hand-crafted behavioral rules, predefined high-definition maps, and localized data sets to coordinate core functions such as sensing, localization, perception, planning, and control. Autoware originated from this architecture and has been successfully deployed in autonomous driving systems around the world.,The new Level 4+ autonomy concept, advocated through this collaboration, represents an intermediate step between SAE J3016 Level 4 and Level 5. ,The Level 4+ system features do not require the human to take over dynamic driving tasks (DDT). However, they may leverage , from outside the system, as part of strategic functions, to dynamically respond to environmental changes within the target operational domain (TOD). Meanwhile, the system continues to control tactical and operational functions. In this framework, the system retains full responsibility for safety assurance, even when , influences its behavior. For example, a human may provide guidance that adjusts waypoint planning at runtime to help the system align its behavior with both the defined ODD and the TOD.,Emerging end-to-end AI models, a key variant of data-centric AI approaches, are promising for realizing Level 4+ autonomy, particularly when integrated with rule-based systems and human-in-the-loop strategies. However, they also present critical challenges, including high data requirements, limited explainability in decision-making, and difficulties in establishing robust safety assurance. Because it is often unclear how such models generalize learned behaviors or what influences their outputs, ensuring trustworthy real-world deployment remains a key hurdle.,To realize Level 4+ autonomy, TIER IV and CMU will jointly develop next-generation Autoware-based autonomous driving systems, with a particular focus on advancing  scalability, explainability, and safety through a hybrid architecture that combines data-centric AI approaches, including refined end-to-end AI models, with the best practices in robotics.,The project will center on modularizing end-to-end AI models to coexist with state-of-the-art robotics methods and safety enforcement mechanisms. Key challenges include incorporating intermediate representations that expose internal reasoning processes, as well as establishing contextual awareness features that allow the system to transition into minimum risk maneuver (MRM) mode when faced with unexpected ,. As a whole, this hybrid architecture is designed to support more transparent and traceable embodied AI decision-making, while addressing practical deployment concerns such as system accountability, safety assessment, and regulatory compliance.,The collaboration is structured as a three-year initiative. In the first year, TIER IV and CMU will develop a reference vehicle powered by Autoware, with early deployments planned in both , and ,. This vehicle will also serve as a platform for real-world data collection, closed-loop verification and validation, and on-road experimentation. Insights from this phase will be reflected back into Autoware and the broader open-source software community, accelerating innovation at CMU and across the global research and developer ecosystem,In the second and third years, the focus will shift toward developing a comprehensive safety enforcement mechanism for the hybrid architecture. This mechanism will support the safety assessment processes required for vehicle certification and public road approval, and will underpin scalability, explainability, and safety necessary for trustworthy real-world deployment of Autoware-based autonomous driving systems.,""This collaboration marks a major milestone in uniting the strengths of AI and robotics to build autonomous driving systems that are safer, more scalable, and more explainable,"" said ,, founder and CEO of TIER IV. ""Partnering with CMU enables us to further advance Autoware's capabilities and deepen our contribution to the open-source software community, driving the future of mobility through collective innovation."",""The integration of modular end-to-end AI models with traditional Level 4 systems represents a powerful advancement for the new Level 4+ autonomy concept,"" said Raj Rajkumar, George Westinghouse Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at ,.

Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.

Defendants' statements, albeit made months after the initial inspection and defendants' initiation of remediation efforts included, among other things, the disclosure of the FDA's issuance of a warning letter and import alert which would prevent Viatris from shipping eleven products from the Indore facility, though four of such were exempt from the limitations (the ""Warning Letter""). Defendants routinely referred to the impact of the Warning Letter as a mere ""minor headwind"" for Viatris.,Further, defendants provided these disclosures to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state impact of the Warning Letter on Viatris' financials. Notably, defendants did not disclose precisely when the inspection occurred, how long the remediation efforts had been implemented, or the financial impact of the existing and continued remediation efforts. Defendants further notably failed to disclose which products were subject to the FDA Warning Letter, which products were subject to exemptions, and the significance of the restricted products with respect to Viatris' existing financials and future projections, and for which Viatris believed it would obtain exemptions. Such statements, absent these material facts, caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Viatris' securities at artificially inflated prices.

Tanto el modelo híbrido como el primer vehículo eléctrico de batería de la serie ES se ofrecerán en una variedad que también incluirá opciones de tracción delantera y total.,
              ,El ES ha sido un fijo en la línea Lexus desde su lanzamiento junto al modelo insignia LS en 1989. El ES está totalmente rediseñado y desarrollado bajo el concepto ""Experimente la elegancia y el sedán eléctrico"". Aspira a ofrecer una experiencia de conducción refinada en todos los escenarios, para mejorar aún más el silencio y el confort de marcha, al tiempo que se mantiene en sintonía con las necesidades de los clientes. El diseño se inspira en el concepto de vehículo eléctrico de batería de nueva generación, el LF-ZC, ya que marca una audaz evolución en el lenguaje de diseño de Lexus que comienza con el nuevo ES.,Profundiza en la expresión de la elegancia, ya que el diseño crea una atmósfera limpia y acogedora. El exterior logra un delicado equilibrio entre un diseño inteligente y unas proporciones que resaltan la belleza inherente del sedán, con lo que se crea una silueta elegante y fluida que deja entrever la emocionante experiencia de conducción que está por llegar.,Desde el lanzamiento del RX 400h en 2005, Lexus ha sido líder en vehículos eléctricos en el mercado de lujo. Guiado por la visión ""Lexus Eléctrico"", Lexus amplía la adopción de vehículos eléctricos, que incluye híbridos, híbridos enchufables y vehículos eléctricos de batería, para satisfacer las diversas necesidades de los clientes y del mercado.,El nuevo ES viene a ser el segundo de los tres nuevos modelos , vehículo eléctrico de batería, cuyo lanzamiento está previsto para marzo de 2026. Cataliza un impulso de producto que coincide con una reimaginación integral de la marca Lexus que se develará en el Salón del Automóvil de Japón en octubre de 2025.,El ES presenta el nuevo concepto de diseño de Lexus: tecnología limpia y elegancia. La elegancia característica que define al ES desde hace mucho tiempo se ha refinado aún más, al tiempo que combina a la perfección su valor funcional y emocional a un nivel superior, lo que da como resultado una estética de diseño sencilla y limpia.,El diseño exterior se inspira en el concepto de vehículo eléctrico de batería de nueva generación, el LF-ZC, que combina una presencia audaz con un minimalismo refinado. La altura del vehículo se determinó cuidadosamente para acomodar la ubicación de la batería bajo el piso y preservar el confort interior, lo que brinda la base para unas proporciones que capturan la forma más bella y expresiva del sedán. Esto llevó a la realización de una carrocería fusiforme de nueva generación, diseñada para encarnar los ideales de los vehículos eléctricos.,Al tomar como base la altura total del nuevo ES, el diseño se centra en lograr las proporciones más elegantes y visualmente impactantes de un sedán. Presume de un perfil fluido y sin maletero, un espacio trasero afilado y una parte inferior de la carrocería moldeada en torno al tema de la integración escultural y plana audaz. Además, los precisos ajustes milimétricos de la posición de los neumáticos contribuyen a lograr una postura ancha y baja.,Inspirado en la filosofía de diseño del LF-ZC, el frontal del nuevo ES integra una forma de huso muy definida que se extiende desde el capó hasta las esquinas del parachoques. El frontal se define por el contraste de altura entre el morro bajo de la carrocería en forma de huso y los guardabarros orientados horizontalmente característicos de un sedán, creando una impresión audaz, aterrizada y distintiva. En los modelos híbridos, se agrega una estilizada parrilla superior para garantizar la refrigeración.,El perfil lateral es tenso y aerodinámico, lo que minimiza la percepción de altura. Los contornos realzados de los costados mejoran la aerodinámica, mientras que la impresión de no tener maletero acentúa una presencia impactante y poderosa.,La parte trasera encarna la elegancia característica del ES con un flujo esculpido desde los neumáticos traseros hasta el maletero, para crear una presencia elegante y dinámica. La carrocería se estrecha de manera audaz hacia la parte trasera, y crea un centro de gravedad bajo que evoca un comportamiento dinámico.,El ES incorpora un nuevo ícono de diseño para la próxima generación, las luces de posición dobles en L. Las luces diurnas orientadas hacia el interior y los intermitentes orientados hacia el exterior forman una doble característica que realza la identidad exclusiva de Lexus, al tiempo que mejora la claridad visual y la funcionalidad de los intermitentes.,La parte trasera incorpora una nueva luz de señalización trasera en L que permite reconocer al instante que se trata de un Lexus. Perfectamente integrada con el logotipo de Lexus iluminado, la barra luminosa única consolida las funciones de luz trasera y de freno, al tiempo que reubica otros elementos de iluminación en los bordes exteriores. Al situar estos elementos más bajos y más hacia el exterior, el diseño enfatiza la postura ancha del vehículo y realza el perfil esculpido de la parte trasera.,Al diseñar la cabina, el objetivo era lograr un conjunto sedán sobresaliente. La plataforma fue rediseñada desde cero, con elementos estructurales clave rediseñados. En comparación con el modelo anterior, la longitud total se amplió en aproximadamente 6.5 pulgadas y la distancia entre ejes en 3 pulgadas, dando como resultado una cabina más espaciosa. Además, la posición de los asientos se ha colocado más alta para mejorar la facilidad de entrada y salida, al tiempo que se ofrece un amplio campo de visión.,Para aumentar aún más la sensación de amplitud, los asientos y los elementos decorativos se han hecho lo más finos posible, y los bordes inferiores de los marcos de las ventanillas delanteras y laterales se han rebajado para aumentar la superficie de vidrio. Con estos esfuerzos, Lexus ha creado un espacio interior sencillo y limpio basado en el concepto de diseño ""tecnología limpia y elegancia"", con una sección superior abierta y ventilada con una mejor visibilidad, contrastada por una sección inferior que envuelve suavemente a los ocupantes.,Por primera vez en Norteamérica, el ES dispone de un paquete Executive que ofrece una cabina trasera más espaciosa y relajante. El paquete está disponible en el modelo ES 350e FWD Luxury (con tracción delantera) e incluye asientos traseros reclinables con otomana en el lado del acompañante, asientos traseros exteriores con masaje, calefacción y ventilación en los asientos traseros.,El guarnecido de las puertas introduce dos elementos de diseño Lexus que elevan la experiencia sensorial. Las capas de bambú recrean la profundidad y la fluidez del bambú natural mediante impresión 3D, junto con la iluminación ambiental temática y nuevos temas dinámicos. El cuero sintético grabado combina un relieve nítido con la iluminación ambiental temática para realzar la atmósfera limpia y elegante de la cabina. Además, el sistema de sonido envolvente , optimiza la ubicación de los altavoces para crear un sonido envolvente y tridimensional en la cabina.,El nuevo habitáculo del ES fue diseñado con base en el concepto , de Lexus, con una distribución interior centrada en el conductor. Entre los elementos tazuna se incluye un capó de perfil bajo que alberga una pantalla de información múltiple de 12,3 pulgadas de diseño único, que permite un movimiento suave de los ojos y crea una sensación abierta y aireada. Un revestimiento especial mejora la calidad de las superficies, mientras que la combinación de materiales de ante y la iluminación ambiental profundizan en la expresión del concepto tazuna.,El ES también estrena la nueva versión del sistema multimedia Lexus Interface. El sistema mejora la experiencia del usuario con un nuevo botón de inicio en pantalla y capacidad de pantalla dividida. Además, el asistente de voz nativo se ha mejorado con tiempos de respuesta más rápidos. La navegación nativa y la funcionalidad de mapas están ahora integradas en el cuadro de instrumentos digital.,Con una pantalla táctil de 14 pulgadas, el sistema incluye de serie compatibilidad inalámbrica con Apple CarPlay® y Android Auto™, y doble conectividad telefónica Bluetooth® simultánea. ,El nuevo ES se desarrolló con el objetivo de crear una experiencia relajante para todos los ocupantes. Con base de los puntos fuertes del ES en cuanto a silencio y confort de marcha, se introdujeron mejoras para mejorar la experiencia general. Al mismo tiempo, se ha profundizado en la sensación de conducción para aprovechar al máximo las características distintivas de los sistemas de transmisión de vehículo eléctrico híbrido y de batería, de una forma exclusiva de Lexus.,El ES está construido sobre una plataforma TNGA GA-K rediseñada, desarrollada específicamente para alojar ambos sistemas de transmisión. La rigidez se ha incrementado significativamente en la parte delantera, el piso y la parte trasera, lo que da como resultado una estructura completamente reforzada. Esta mejora reduce las vibraciones de la carrocería y permite una dirección precisa e intuitiva, junto con una aceleración y deceleración suaves. El resultado es una sensación de conducción ágil y sensible que desafía el tamaño del vehículo.,Por primera vez en un ES, se adopta una suspensión trasera de brazos múltiples, que mejora tanto la entrega de potencia al piso como el control de la postura del vehículo. El ES está equipado con una suspensión delantera MacPherson.,El ES 350h ofrece mayores prestaciones de potencia, junto con la disponibilidad de un modelo con tracción total (AWD). El sistema híbrido de 2.5 litros de sexta generación cuenta con un eAxle (eje de vehículo eléctrico) integrado que combina la unidad de control de potencia y el transeje, lo que contribuye a una transmisión más compacta y ligera, a la vez que consigue una mayor potencia de la batería.,Además, la rigidez reforzada de la unidad de potencia ayuda a suprimir las vibraciones, lo que contribuye a una experiencia en la cabina más silenciosa y refinada.,La variedad de vehículos eléctricos de batería ofrece dos modelos: el ES 350e de tracción delantera y el ES 500e de tracción total.,Una batería de gran capacidad está situada debajo del piso para bajar el centro de gravedad y mejorar la estabilidad de conducción. Además, el ES 500e está equipado con DIRECT4 AWD, un sistema inteligente de tracción total que ajusta continuamente la distribución del par a las cuatro ruedas en función de las condiciones de la carretera y de la conducción. El sistema utiliza una relación de fuerza motriz entre las ruedas delanteras y traseras que oscila entre 100:0 y 0:100. Esto mejora la aceleración desde parado, proporciona una mayor estabilidad de manejo y contribuye a una gran eficiencia energética.,El ES 350e tiene una autonomía estimada por el fabricante de 300 millas cuando está equipado con llantas de 19"".,El ES viene a ser el primer modelo Lexus en recibir el Lexus Safety System+ 4.0 (LSS+ 4.0). La nueva versión del paquete de seguridad activa de Lexus contará con actualizaciones en su hardware y capacidades de detección. ,El ES 2026 saldrá a la venta el año que viene.

Cost of deposits, excluding wholesale deposits, was 1.34% for the quarter compared to 1.55% for the prior quarter and 2.52% for the year-ago period.

(NYSE: ,), the global leader in innovative and sustainable vertical flight solutions, today announced a long-term agreement to provide enhanced support for Bristow's S-92, helicopter fleet.,
              ,This agreement deepens the decades-long collaboration between the two companies and provides enhanced support for Bristow's more than 60 S-92 aircraft operating in key markets around the world, including offshore energy and search and rescue (SAR). The long-term package extending into the next decade includes Sikorsky's Total Assurance Program (TAP), which provides Bristow with continued aftermarket support to operate its S-92 fleet within a known budget, reducing the risk of unplanned costs.,""We are proud to continue our long-standing relationship with Bristow, one of the world's leading providers of helicopter services to the offshore energy industry,"" said ,, vice president of Global Commercial and Military Systems at Sikorsky. ""We are committed to providing exceptional support to our customers and ensuring the continued success of the S-92 helicopter, which has a lifetime availability average of over 90% and many aircraft achieve more than 1,500 flight hours per year on average in the demanding offshore energy industry."",""Bristow is the largest operator of the S-92 globally,"" said ,, Bristow's Chief Operating Officer, Offshore Energy Services. ""This long-term support agreement will enable us to maintain our high level of service to our customers, while also controlling our operational costs and improving our overall efficiency."",The TAP package includes the following support provisions for Bristow's global fleet:,This agreement reflects Sikorsky's continued commitment to the commercial market and investment in the S-92 platform, which is well-positioned to support the increasing demands of deepwater operations. Sikorsky recently unveiled the S-92 Phase IV main gearbox featuring an auxiliary lubrication system that automatically engages in the event of primary oil pressure loss, eliminating the need for immediate landing and allowing operators to safely reach their destination. This revolutionary solution has been validated through more than 800 hours of rigorous testing, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification is anticipated in 2025.,Sikorsky also increased scheduled inspection intervals for the S-92 helicopter and offered a one-time life extension for specific main gearbox housings. These enhancements eliminate more than a full year of downtime caused by inspections and allow operators to safely keep their aircraft in service and generating revenues longer. The earned life credit is up to 1,200 hours / 3,600 ground-air-ground cycles, representing an additional 12 to 18 months for an average S-92 offshore oil operator and more than 24 months for others.,For additional information, visit our website: ,This press release contains ""forward-looking statements.""

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than ,. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.,Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over , for investors. In 2020, founding partner , was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.,Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, the Registration Statement contained false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose the risks concerning Ibotta's contract with The Kroger Co. (""Kroger""). Kroger's contract was at-will, and Ibotta failed to warn investors that a large client could cancel their contract with Ibotta without warning. Despite providing a detailed explanation of the terms of Ibotta's contract with another large customer, there was not a single warning of the at-will nature of Kroger's contract. Rather than disclosing the very real risk of a major client walking away at any time, Ibotta provided boilerplate warnings concerning the importance of maintaining ongoing relationships with their clients. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.,To join the Ibotta action, go to , or call , toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email , for information on the class action.,No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point.

earnings per share were ,, with an adjusted, return on assets of 1.33% and an adjusted, return on tangible common equity of 17.8%.  Our net interest margin remains strong, but declined slightly for the quarter as the decline in loan yields outpaced the decrease in deposit costs.  Given current short-term interest rates, we expect the margin to expand in the near-term."" ,Mr. Brown continued, ""Loan balances were stable during the quarter.  First quarter loan production was seasonally lower.  This combined with the workout of several C&I credits and accelerated payoff pressure in the ICRE portfolio to impact loan growth for the period.  We expect a modest level of growth in the second quarter as loan pipelines in our Consumer, C&I, and ICRE business lines are very healthy, however elevated prepayments in ICRE are expected to continue."",Mr. Brown commented on fee income and expenses, ""Adjusted, fee income was in line with our expectations at ,, representing a decline from the linked quarter due to seasonal fluctuations and less foreign exchange income, which offset another record quarter from our Wealth Management business.  We expect seasonal rebounds in the second quarter and a healthy increase in fee income overall.  We were very pleased with our expense management during the quarter, as adjusted, noninterest expenses declined by 3.3% due to a decrease in incentive compensation and lower , losses.  Our efficiency efforts are ongoing, and, excluding the acquisition of Agile in the first quarter of last year, have resulted in a 7% reduction in FTE.  We remain diligent in managing our expenses and expect additional benefits from our optimization efforts in the coming periods."",Mr. Brown commented on asset quality and capital, ""We were pleased with improvements in our asset quality metrics for the first quarter.  Net charge-offs declined 4 bps from the linked quarter, while nonperforming assets declined by 9.5%.  In the near-term, we expect asset quality to continue to improve.  With respect to tariffs, we do not yet know their impact, and remain in close contact with our clients to assist them through any uncertainty.  Capital ratios are strong and continued to grow in the first quarter.  All regulatory ratios were well in excess of regulatory minimums and our tangible common equity ratio increased to 8.2%.  Tangible book value

We provide this information to investors to enable them to perform comparisons of our past, present and future operating results and as a means to evaluate the results of core on-going operations. We have historically reported these measures to our investors and believe that the continued inclusion of the Non-GAAP Measures provides consistency in our financial reporting. We also believe this information is useful to investors in allowing greater transparency related to significant measures used by our management in their financial and operational decision-making, their evaluation of total company and individual property performance, in the evaluation of incentive compensation and in the annual budget process. Management also uses Non-GAAP Measures in the evaluation of potential acquisitions and dispositions. We believe these measures continue to be used by investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our company. ,The use of Non-GAAP Measures has certain limitations.

While excluded from certain of the Non-GAAP Measures, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, income taxes and other items have been and will be incurred. Each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of our results. Additionally, the Non-GAAP Measures do not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of our depreciation and amortization, interest and income taxes, capital expenditures and other items both in our reconciliations to the historical GAAP financial measures and in our consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Non-GAAP Measures to the corresponding forward-looking GAAP measure due to our inability to project special charges and certain expenses.,The Non-GAAP Measures are to be used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP, nor should these measures be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. The Non-GAAP Measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding historical GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure.

We converted five acres of non-income producing land into an income producing ground lease, demonstrating the strategic, capital efficient, internal growth opportunities that exist in our portfolio. Lastly, we progressed through our streamlining efforts by selling 90 acres of primarily agriculture-zoned land and settling certain liabilities at a legacy joint venture."",Below is a summary of select consolidated financial results.,Below is a summary of select CRE financial results.,The Company revised its outlook for 2025 as follows.,Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. (NYSE: ,) (A&B) is the only publicly-traded real estate investment trust to focus exclusively on Hawai'i commercial real estate and is the state's largest owner of grocery-anchored, neighborhood shopping centers. A&B owns, operates and manages approximately four million square feet of commercial space in Hawai'i, including 21 retail centers, 14 industrial assets, four office properties, and 146 acres of ground lease assets. Over its 155-year history, A&B has evolved with the state's economy and played a leadership role in the development of the agricultural, transportation, tourism, construction, residential and commercial real estate industries.,Learn more about A&B at ,. ,(808) 525-8475, ,The Company uses non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because management believes that they provide additional insight into the Company's and segments' operating results, and/or the underlying business trends affecting performance on a consistent and comparable basis from period to period. These measures generally are provided to investors as an additional means of evaluating the performance of ongoing operations. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.,NOI is a non-GAAP measure used internally in evaluating the unlevered performance of the Company's Commercial Real Estate portfolio. Management believes NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only the contract-based income that is realizable (i.e., assuming collectability is deemed probable) and direct property-related expenses paid or payable in cash that are incurred at the property level, as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. When compared across periods, NOI can be used to determine trends in earnings of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by non-contract-based revenue (e.g., straight-line lease adjustments required under GAAP and amortization of lease incentives and favorable/unfavorable lease assets/liabilities); by non-cash expense recognition items (e.g., the impact of depreciation related to capitalized costs for improved properties and building/tenant space improvements, amortization of leasing commissions, or impairments); by non-cash income related to sales-type leases; or by other income, expenses, gains, or losses that do not directly relate to the Company's ownership and operations of the properties (e.g., indirect selling, general, administrative and other expenses, as well as lease termination income and interest and other income (expense), net). Management believes the exclusion of these items from Commercial Real Estate operating profit (loss) is useful because it provides a performance measure of the revenue and expenses directly involved in owning and operation real estate assets. NOI should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.,The Company reports NOI and Occupancy on a Same-Store basis, which includes the results of properties that were owned, operated, and stabilized for the entirety of the prior calendar year and current reporting period, year-to-date.,The Same-Store pool excludes properties under development, and properties acquired or sold during either of the comparable reporting periods. The Same-Store pool may also exclude properties that are fully or partially taken out of service for the purpose of redevelopment or repositioning. Management judgment is involved in the classification of properties for exclusion from the same-store pool when they are no longer considered stabilized due to redevelopment or other factors. Properties are moved into the Same-Store pool after one full calendar year of stabilized operation. Management believes that reporting on a Same-Store basis provides investors with additional information regarding the operating performance of comparable assets separate from other factors (such as the effect of developments, redevelopments, acquisitions or dispositions).,Reconciliations of CRE operating profit to , and Same-Store NOI are as follows:,The forward looking guidance included in this release includes certain forward-looking information, including CRE Same-Store NOI growth %, that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. In reliance on the exception in Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, we do not provide a quantitative reconciliation of such forward-looking CRE Same-Store NOI growth % amounts to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These forward-looking same-store calculations include only activity from properties owned for comparable periods. We are unable, without unreasonable effort, to provide a meaningful or reasonably accurate calculation or estimation of certain reconciling items, including but not limited to, (i) occupancy changes; (ii) terms for new and renewal leases; (iii) collections from tenants; and (iv) other nonrecurring/unplanned income or expense items. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond our control, and the unavailable components could have a significant impact on our future financial results.,FFO serves as a supplemental measure to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP and management believes is useful for comparing the Company's performance and operations to those of other REITs because it excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of its operating and financial performance, such as depreciation and amortization related to real estate, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time instead of fluctuating with market conditions, and items that can make periodic or peer analysis more difficult, such as gains and losses from the sale of CRE properties, impairment losses related to CRE properties, and income (loss) from discontinued operations. Management believes that FFO more accurately provides an investor an indication of the Company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and fund other needs.,FFO related to CRE and Corporate is a supplemental non-GAAP measure that refines FFO to reflect the operating performance of the Company's commercial real estate business. FFO related to CRE and Corporate is calculated by adjusting FFO to exclude the operating performance of the Company's Land Operations segment. The Company also provides a reconciliation from CRE Operating Profit to FFO related to CRE and Corporate by including corporate, interest, and income tax expenses attributable to its commercial real estate business, and by excluding gains or losses on and depreciation and amortization of CRE properties, as well as distributions to participating securities. Management believes that FFO related to CRE and Corporate provides an additional measure to compare the Company's performance by excluding legacy items from the Land Operations segment.,FFO and FFO related to CRE and Corporate do not represent alternatives to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as more prominent measures of performance than net income (loss) or cash flows from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO and FFO related to CRE and Corporate do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, nor should they be used as measures of the Company's liquidity, or cash available to fund the Company's needs or pay distributions. FFO and FFO related to CRE and Corporate should be considered only as supplements to net income as a measure of the Company's performance.,The Company reconciles FFO and FFO related to CRE and Corporate to the most directly-comparable GAAP measure, Net Income (Loss) available to A&B common shareholders. The Company's FFO and FFO related to CRE and Corporate may not be comparable to such metrics reported by other REITs due to possible differences in the interpretation of the current Nareit definition used by such REITs,Reconciliations of net income (loss) available to A&B common shareholders to FFO are as follows (amounts in thousands):,Reconciliations of net income (loss) available to A&B common shareholders to FFO related to CRE and Corporate, and CRE operating profit to FFO related to CRE and Corporate, are as follows (amounts in thousands):,Reconciliations of net income (loss) available to A&B common shareholders per diluted share, to the forward-looking range of FFO per diluted share, are as follows:,Net Debt is calculated by adjusting the Company's total debt to its notional amount (by excluding unamortized premium, discount and capitalized loan fees) and by subtracting cash and cash equivalents recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.,A reconciliation of the Company's Net Debt is as follows.,The Company may report various forms of EBITDA (e.g. Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, and Land Operations EBITDA) as non-GAAP measures used by the Company in evaluating the segments' and Company's operating performance on a consistent and comparable basis from period to period. The Company provides this information to investors as an additional means of evaluating the performance of the segments' and Company's ongoing operations.,The Company also adjusts Consolidated EBITDA to arrive at Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for items identified as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual that are not expected to recur in the segment's normal operations (or in the Company's core business).,As an illustrative example, the Company identified non-cash impairment as a non-recurring, infrequent or unusual item that is not expected to recur in the consolidated or segment's normal operations. By excluding these items from Consolidated EBITDA to arrive at Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, the Company believes it provides meaningful supplemental information about its operating performance and facilitates comparisons to historical operating results. Such non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.,Reconciliations of the Company's consolidated net income to Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA are as follows:,Statements in this release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the relevant forward-looking statements.

The involuntary movements of TD can also have a substantial impact on older adults, affecting their balance, gait, ability to swallow and respiratory conditions. The data from this post-hoc analysis show substantial and sustained improvements in TD symptoms in older adults, with no new treatment-emergent adverse events of clinical concern found when compared with younger adults (<65 years).,""This analysis, the first and only of its kind in a peer-reviewed publication, addresses an important gap in research on this potentially vulnerable population,"" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Neurocrine Biosciences. ""These data show that participants 65 years and older achieved clinically meaningful improvements in tardive dyskinesia symptoms within eight weeks of INGREZZA treatment, with substantial and sustained improvement up to 48 weeks, adding to the breadth of evidence suggesting INGREZZA is uniquely suitable for this patient population."",The pooled post-hoc analysis included 304 participants across studies who received a once-daily dose of INGREZZA (40 mg or 80 mg) for up to 48 weeks. Of the total participants, 55 (18.1%) were 65 years and older. At Week 48, efficacy and safety outcomes were analyzed by dose (40 mg, 80 mg) and age (<65 years, ≥65 years).,The efficacy of INGREZZA was assessed using mean changes from baseline in the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) total score, AIMS response thresholds (≥30% and ≥50% improvement from baseline) and response threshold for Clinical Global Impression of Change-Tardive Dyskinesia (CGI-TD) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), defined as a score ≤2 (""much improved"" or ""very much improved""). At baseline, participants in both age subgroups had a mean AIMS total score of approximately 12, consistent with moderate to severe severity in one or more body regions. The safety profile of INGREZZA was evaluated through adverse event monitoring and psychiatric symptom scales.,Data from this analysis of participants ≥65 years in the KINECT 3 extension and KINECT 4 studies suggest substantial and sustained improvements in TD symptoms with INGREZZA treatment (all doses):,Overall, psychiatric stability was maintained through 48 weeks of treatment and INGREZZA was generally well tolerated. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events reported from Weeks 8 to 48 included urinary tract infection and somnolence; each occurred in six of the 55 participants who were 65 years and older.,There were no statistically significant differences between age groups (<65 versus ≥65) for most efficacy and safety outcomes at Week 48., ,KINECT 3 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study in which 234 participants with moderate to severe TD and underlying schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or mood disorder (including bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) received six weeks of once-daily INGREZZA (40 mg or 80 mg capsules) or placebo (participants randomized to 80 mg started on 40 mg for one week). Subsequent to the completion of the six-week placebo-controlled dosing, participants receiving INGREZZA continued on their current dose and placebo participants were randomized to receive either once-daily 40 mg or once-daily 80 mg of INGREZZA, through Week 48 (42-week blinded treatment extension period; placebo participants randomized to 80 mg started on 40 mg for one week), followed by a four-week, drug-free washout. Dose reduction to 40 mg was allowed for participants who were unable to tolerate the 80 mg dose. Patients were discontinued if the new dose was not tolerated.,The study met its primary endpoint of change-from-baseline in AIMS at Week 6 in the 80 mg once-daily dosing group compared with placebo as assessed by expert central blinded video raters. The mean change from baseline to Week 6 in the AIMS rating was -3.2 for the 80 mg once-daily group as compared with -0.1 in the placebo group (,>0.0001). Sustained TD improvements were seen with INGREZZA 40 mg and 80 mg through Week 48.,INGREZZA was generally well tolerated throughout 48 weeks of treatment. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and twice the rate of placebo) during the six-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase was somnolence with the frequency of adverse events being similar among all treatment groups. Treatment-emergent adverse events  were consistent with those of prior studies. There were no drug-drug interactions identified in participants who were utilizing a wide range of psychotropic and other concomitant medications, and participants generally remained psychiatrically stable throughout the study.,KINECT 4 is a Phase 3, open-label study in which 163 participants with moderate to severe TD and underlying schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or mood disorder (including bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) received 48 weeks of open-label treatment with once-daily INGREZZA (40 mg or 80 mg capsules) followed by a four-week washout. Dosing was initiated at 40 mg/day in all participants, with escalation to 80 mg/day at Week 4 based on effectiveness and tolerability. Dose reduction to 40 mg was allowed in participants who could not tolerate the 80 mg dose. Patients were discontinued if the new dose was not tolerated.,Participants experienced TD improvements during long-term treatment as demonstrated by mean change from baseline to Week 48 in AIMS total score (sum of items 1-7, evaluated by site raters) with INGREZZA 40 mg/day (-10.2) or 80 mg/day (-11.0). Consistent with previous studies, INGREZZA was generally well tolerated. After Week 4, treatment-emergent adverse events  that occurred in ≥5% of all participants (combined dose groups) were urinary tract infection (8.5%) and headache (5.2%). Changes from baseline in psychiatric stability, vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters and laboratory test values were generally small and not clinically significant.,Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder that is characterized by uncontrollable, abnormal and repetitive movements of the face, torso and/or other body parts, which may be disruptive and negatively impact patients. The condition is associated with taking certain kinds of mental health medicines (antipsychotics) that help control dopamine receptors in the brain. Taking antipsychotics commonly prescribed to treat mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and other prescription medicines (metoclopramide and prochlorperazine) used to treat gastrointestinal disorders are associated with TD. In patients with TD, these treatments are thought to result in irregular dopamine signaling in a region of the brain that controls movement. The symptoms of TD can be mild to severe and are often persistent and irreversible. TD is estimated to affect at least 800,000 adults in the U.S.,INGREZZA is a selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia and the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD). Only INGREZZA offers a therapeutic dose from day one with no required titration.,INGREZZA, developed by Neurocrine Biosciences, selectively inhibits VMAT2 with no appreciable binding affinity for VMAT1, dopaminergic (including D2), serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors. While the specific way INGREZZA works to treat TD and HD chorea is not fully understood, INGREZZA is unique in that it selectively and specifically targets VMAT2 to inhibit the release of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps control movement. INGREZZA is believed to reduce extra dopamine signaling, which may lead to fewer uncontrollable movements.,INGREZZA is proven across the widest range of patients. It is always one capsule, once daily and can be taken together with most stable mental health regimens such as antipsychotics or antidepressants. Only INGREZZA offers the benefit of a sprinkle formulation, INGREZZA SPRINKLE, for those who experience dysphagia, have difficulty swallowing or prefer not to swallow a pill. INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE dosages approved for use are 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg capsules.,INGREZZA, (valbenazine) capsules or INGREZZA, SPRINKLE (valbenazine) capsules are prescription medicines used to treat adults with:,It is not known if INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is safe and effective in children., Tell your healthcare provider before you start taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you have Huntington's disease and are depressed (have untreated depression or depression that is not well controlled by medicine) or have suicidal thoughts.

FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, provision for impairment, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), our share of unconsolidated JV real estate related depreciation & amortization, net income attributable to non-controlling interests in operating partnership and reconciling items related to non-controlling interests. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our data centers that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our data centers, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the Nareit definition and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' FFO. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.,We present core funds from operations, or Core FFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, in excluding certain items that do not reflect core revenue or expense streams, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in our core business operating performance. We calculate Core FFO by adding to or subtracting from FFO (i) other non-core revenue adjustments, (ii) transaction and integration expenses, (iii) loss on debt extinguishment and modifications, (iv) gain on / issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock, (v) severance, equity acceleration and legal expenses, (vi) gain/loss on FX and derivatives revaluation, and (vii) other non-core expense adjustments. Because certain of these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of Core FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may calculate Core FFO differently than we do and accordingly, our Core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' Core FFO. Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.,We present adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, when compared year over year, it assesses our ability to fund dividend and distribution requirements from our operating activities. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, AFFO will be used by investors as a basis to assess our ability to fund dividend payments in comparison to other REITs, including on a per share and unit basis. We calculate AFFO by adding to or subtracting from Core FFO (i) non-real estate depreciation, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs, (iii) amortization of debt discount/premium, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (v) straight-line rental revenue, (vi) straight-line rental expense, (vii) above- and below-market rent amortization, (viii) deferred tax expense / (benefit), (ix) leasing compensation and internal lease commissions, and (x) recurring capital expenditures. Other REITs may calculate AFFO differently than we do and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs' AFFO. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.,We believe that earnings before interest, loss on debt extinguishment and modifications, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), are useful supplemental performance measures because they allow investors to view our performance without the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization or the cost of debt and, with respect to Adjusted EBITDA, (i) unconsolidated joint venture real estate related depreciation & amortization, (ii) unconsolidated joint venture interest expense and tax, (iii) severance, equity acceleration and legal expenses, (iv) transaction and integration expenses, (v) gain (loss) on sale / deconsolidation, (vi) provision for impairment, (vii) other non-core adjustments, net, (viii) non-controlling interests, (ix) preferred stock dividends, and (x) issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA excluding (i) unconsolidated joint venture real estate related depreciation & amortization, (ii) unconsolidated joint venture interest expense and tax, (iii) severance, equity acceleration and legal expenses, (iv) transaction and integration expenses, (v) gain (loss) on sale / deconsolidation, (vi) provision for impairment, (vii) other non-core adjustments, net, (viii) non-controlling interests, (ix) preferred stock dividends, and (x) gain on / issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock. In addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and income taxes, exclude capitalized costs, such as leasing commissions, and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our business, their utility as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and, accordingly, our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other REITs' EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our financial performance.,11,Net operating income, or NOI, represents rental revenue, tenant reimbursement revenue and interconnection revenue less utilities expense, rental property operating expenses, property taxes and insurance expenses (as reflected in the statement of operations). NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measurement of operating performance of the company's rental portfolio. Cash NOI is NOI less straight-line rents and above- and below-market rent amortization. Cash NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measure of property operating performance on a cash basis. Same-Capital Cash NOI represents buildings owned as of , of the prior year with less than 5% of total rentable square feet under development and excludes buildings that were undergoing, or were expected to undergo, development activities in 2024-2025, buildings classified as held for sale and contribution, and buildings sold or contributed to joint ventures for all periods presented (prior period numbers adjusted to reflect current same-capital pool). However, because NOI and cash NOI exclude depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of our data centers that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our data centers, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of NOI and cash NOI as measures of our performance is limited. Other REITs may calculate NOI and cash NOI differently than we do and, accordingly, our NOI and cash NOI may not be comparable to other REITs' NOI and cash NOI. NOI and cash NOI should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as measures of our performance.,Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated as total debt at balance sheet carrying value, plus capital lease obligations, plus Digital Realty's pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt, less cash and cash equivalents (including Digital Realty's pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture cash) divided by the product of Adjusted EBITDA (including Digital Realty's pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture EBITDA), multiplied by four.,Debt-plus-preferred-to-total enterprise value is total debt plus preferred stock divided by total debt plus the liquidation value of preferred stock and the market value of outstanding Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units, assuming the redemption of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units for shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock.,Fixed charge coverage ratio is Adjusted EBITDA divided by the sum of GAAP interest expense, capitalized interest and preferred stock dividends. For the quarter ended ,, GAAP interest expense was $98 million, capitalized interest was , and preferred stock dividends was ,.,12,This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.

The most significant factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements include the ongoing impact of higher tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, higher inflation levels, and general economic and recessionary concerns, all of which could impact economic growth and could cause an increase in loan delinquencies, a reduction in financial transactions and business activities including decreased deposits and reduced loan originations, difficulties in managing liquidity in a rapidly changing and unpredictable market, and supply chain disruptions. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following factors: the integration of the businesses of the Company and Cornerstone Bank following the completion of the transaction; the global impact of the military conflicts in the , and the ,; the impact of any future pandemics or other natural disasters; civil unrest, rioting, acts or threats of terrorism, or actions taken by the local, state and Federal governments in response to such events, which could impact business and economic conditions in our market area; the strength of , economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which the Company and Bank conduct operations; the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; market and monetary fluctuations; market volatility; the value of the Bank's products and services as perceived by actual and prospective customers, including the features, pricing and quality compared to competitors' products and services; the willingness of customers to substitute competitors' products and services for the Bank's products and services; credit risk associated with the Bank's lending activities; risks relating to the real estate market and the Bank's real estate collateral; the impact of changes in applicable laws and regulations and requirements arising out of our supervision by banking regulators; other regulatory requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank; and the timing and nature of the regulatory response to any applications filed by the Company and the Bank; technological changes; other acquisitions; changes in consumer spending and saving habits; those risks under the heading ""Risk Factors"" set forth in the Bank's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended ,, 2024,  and the success of the Company at managing the risks involved in the foregoing.,The Company cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company, except as required by applicable law or regulation.,This press release contains certain supplemental financial information, described in the table below, which has been determined by methods other than U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"") that management uses in its analysis of its performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are ""tangible book value per common share,"" ""return on average tangible equity,"" ""efficiency ratio,"" ""adjusted efficiency ratio,"" ""tangible equity to tangible assets,"" and ""net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent."" For the purpose of calculating return on average tangible equity, net income for such period is annualized and divided by average tangible equity during such period. Average tangible equity equals average shareholders' equity during the applicable period less average goodwill and other intangible assets during the applicable period. For the purpose of calculating tangible equity to tangible assets, tangible equity is divided by tangible assets. Tangible equity equals total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, in each case at period end. Tangible assets equal total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, in each case at period end. For the purpose of calculating tangible book value per common share, tangible equity is divided by the number of common shares outstanding, in each case at period end.  For the purpose of calculating efficiency ratio, total operating expense is divided by total revenue for the period. For the purpose of calculating adjusted efficiency ratio, total operating expense minus core deposit intangible amortization and merger-related expenses is divided by total revenue for the period.  For the purpose of calculating net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent, fully taxable equivalent adjustments are added to net interest income for the period, net interest income fully taxable equivalent for such period is annualized and divided by average interest earning assets during such period. Adjusted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income adjusted for the provision for credit loss on non-purchase credit deteriorated loans and merger-related expenses by weighted outstanding shares.,Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide valuable insights into understanding our financial results by excluding certain items that can distort our core business results. This allows investors to better understand our ongoing operations and assess our future potential, while still being transparent about the adjustments made to arrive at these non-GAAP figures. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results and the Company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.,In addition to the items noted above, defined footnotes are included in the Supplemental Information – Non-GAAP Financial Measures table below. Income annualized is calculated using income for the period divided by the number of days in the period, then multiplied by total days in the year. Average equity is calculated using the sum of daily equity balance for the period, divided by the number of days in the period. Fully taxable equivalent adjustment is calculated using tax exempt loan income plus tax exempt securities income for the period, multiplied by a tax rate of 28%.,SOURCE The Bank of "

In 2022, nearly 50,000 lives were lost to suicide, 13.2 million people reported seriously considering suicide, 1.6 million reported a suicide attempt, and millions more supported someone close to them who was in distress (,). According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the eleventh leading cause of death overall in the U.S., the second leading cause of death for youth ages 10-14 and young adults ages 25-34, and the third leading cause for teens and young adults ages 15-24 (,). Since the launch of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline in ,, over 14 million contacts have been made from individuals in suicidal crisis or in mental health-related distress (,).

              ,The , emphasizes the need to train health professionals and the gaps in knowledge and clinical practices of providers. Despite mental health professionals regularly coming into contact with individuals who are at risk of suicide, the vast majority do not typically receive routine training in suicide assessment, treatment, or risk management. Lack of expertise impacts the ability to provide comprehensive care for at-risk patients, despite evidence that having a competent clinical workforce is critical to reducing the rate of suicide. Studies suggest limited suicide prevention training, with less than 50% of psychology, 25% of social work, and 5% of counseling trainees receiving any training in suicide prevention during their graduate programs (,). In a Zero Suicide Workforce Survey assessing suicide prevention knowledge in a wide array of mental health professionals (including social workers, case managers, counselors, therapists, administrators) 52.9% of participants reported no previous suicide training, and more specifically, 60% of social workers and case managers reported no previous suicide training. (,).,Although no national standards exist for suicide prevention training for health professionals, existing multilevel approaches to suicide prevention, such as the ""Zero Suicide"" framework, offers a model that includes training. Currently, 17 states encourage suicide prevention training for mental health professionals, but only 11 states require training in suicide assessment, treatment, and management for health professionals. (,). Suicide-specific training enhances the level of care that people who experience mental health conditions and suicide risk receive while also increasing provider competence and ability to provide effective, life-saving treatment (,). Training is especially important due to the possible personal and professional impacts on mental health providers working with suicidal clients, including increased feelings of stress anxiety, burnout, and professionals contemplating career change.

Suicide prevention training is associated with increased levels of mental health professionals' skills and confidence, with even brief training having a positive impact on mental health professionals' assessment of their skills and confidence.

Pretomanid is now available through the Global Drug Facility (GDF) at just , per treatment course—less than , per day, a key pricing benchmark identified by the global TB advocacy community. This latest price drop—down from , upon pretomanid's initial approval in 2019, and down further from , in October 2024—reflects ongoing efforts by TB Alliance and its partners to broaden access and improve affordability through a multi-manufacturer approach to access.,TB Alliance, a nonprofit organization that developed pretomanid, has pioneered an innovative access model by partnering with multiple quality-assured manufacturers. This strategy helped launch pretomanid at an initial low price and ensured rapid, sustainable, and affordable access across high-TB burden countries. Simultaneously, by enabling healthy competition and fostering multiple high-quality supply sources, TB Alliance's strategy expanded availability while driving down costs.,""This progress demonstrates how thoughtful collaboration and planning can translate into real-world impact,"" said Dr. ,, President and CEO of TB Alliance.

Even after symptoms disappear, medicines still need to be taken so that all traces of the disease can be fully eradicated. The scope and intensity of TB globally is in large part fueled by antiquated and inadequate TB drugs. Novel drug regimens are urgently needed to bring the TB pandemic under control.,The BPaL regimen—which combines the antibiotics bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (Pa), and linezolid (L)—was first clinically studied by TB Alliance. Pretomanid, as part of the BPaL regimen, received its first regulatory approval in , for use against highly drug-resistant strains of TB. Previously, less than two-thirds of drug-resistant TB patients around the world had been successfully treated. Treatment options were limited, expensive, toxic, and lengthy – requiring patients to take more than 20 pills per day for 9-20 months.,TB Alliance is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to finding faster-acting and affordable drug regimens to fight TB.

In this new Occasional Paper, NSSA's Moorman Center for Space Studies Chair, ,, posits a set of national assets that should be defended via the Golden Dome air and missile defense system and describes how even limited defenses will contribute to U.S. national security.,
              ,In ,, a group of American scientific experts, tasked with developing a strategy to defend the nation against the threat posed by Soviet bombers, produced a report for U.S. military leaders. Entitled ""Problems of Air Defense: Final Report of PROJECT CHARLES"", the report had a significant impact on U.S. air defense technology development, operational strategies, organizational alignment, and funding through the 1950s. Among other noteworthy findings and recommendations, the report stated:,The PROJECT CHARLES report should be required reading by Department of Defense (DoD) officials tasked with designing and fielding the Golden Dome homeland air and missile defense system that President , directed by Executive Order. ,In a recent op-ed, Dr. , and I described increasing threats to the homeland and offered recommendations for how to adapt the military requirements process within the Department of Defense to ensure the rapid fielding of key elements of Golden Dome. Specifically, we recommended that:,DoD leaders should reject the traditional requirements process, which involves establishing detailed performance specifications for a system that will be fielded years in the future and instead embrace a more agile and flexible approach…. Secretary of Defense , and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General , should direct adoption of an incremental approach to requirements that lays out achievable objectives for each of the four homeland defense ""epochs"" proposed by the Missile Defense Agency…. A ""build a little, test a lot, and refine and upgrade as deployments expand"" strategy would allow technology developments and test results to inform decisions as to which combinations of capabilities should be fielded and at what pace and scale. [This] incremental approach is entirely consistent with the President's direction to DoD to establish and leverage ""capabilities- based requirements"" for Golden Dome. It also presents an opportunity to fully embrace agile acquisition authorities that are often talked about but sparingly implemented.,The remainder of this paper will focus on the equally important topic of which targets should be defended as part of Golden Dome.,There are several target categories that merit protection from the Golden Dome air and missile defense system. These include:,Key attributes of a Golden Dome capability should include ,for effective defense of high-value targets, ,that assures several opportunities to engage and defeat individual threats, and ,including ground-, air-, sea- and space-based defenses – each of which contribute uniquely to complicating adversary attack planning, bolstering deterrence, and defending against attacks, should deterrence fail.,It would be a grave mistake to set too high a bar for the requirements associated with initial Golden Dome deployments. Indeed, a Golden Dome air and missile defense system-of-systems that provides even modest protection across the aforementioned target categories would be a major contributor to U.S. national security. In addition, initial limited deployments together with robust testing can help inform future requirements as well as provide valuable data to guide architectural trade studies (eg, determining the proper mix of ground-, air-, sea- and space-based interceptors and sensors).,Finally, it is worth underscoring that the Golden Dome system need not be perfect in order to contribute promptly and meaningfully to U.S. national security. Opponents will offer stale arguments that only ""leakproof"" defenses are of value and because 100 percent effectiveness cannot be assured, it is not worth pursuing homeland air and missile defense. This argument was never convincing. No other military system is held to that impossible standard. Furthermore, remaining defenseless invites attacks on the homeland and broader aggression by America's increasingly well-armed adversaries.,Today's civilian and military leaders who have been assigned the weighty responsibility of designing, developing, fielding and operating the Golden Dome system can take heart in knowing that prior generations wrestled with the thorny problem of how best to defend the homeland – and did not back down from the challenge. As the authors of the PROJECT CHARLES report wisely noted, ""A strong air defense is costly in terms of men as well as in dollars, but it is a necessary element of military strength."",Indeed. Now, nearly seventy-five years later, it's time to get on with ""correcting known weaknesses and exploiting technological advances"" for effective air and missile defense of the homeland.,NSSA is the only U.S. trade association dedicated solely to promoting the health and vitality of the U.S. national security space enterprise (Title 10 and Title 50) and its supporting industry partners.

Chin and KIC Ventures,"April 27, 2025","Apr 24, 2025, 14:45 ET","From the OR to the boardroom, a growing wave of entrepreneurial physicians is reshaping the future of spine surgery and healthcare innovation.,, , /PRNewswire/ -- Twenty-five years ago, before ""physician-led innovation"" became a trend, Dr. Kingsley R. Chin—a ,-trained orthopedic spine surgeon—broke the rules of the legacy medical device world. Surgeons weren't supposed to be owners, founders, or investors. But Dr. Chin charted a different path, building intellectual property, founding companies, and raising capital from fellow physicians to commercialize technologies that improved patient outcomes.,
              ,Through legal scrutiny, shifting markets, and industry resistance, he forged ahead—demonstrating the adaptability and resilience familiar to every surgeon. Today, KIC Ventures stands as one of the only physician-led healthcare investment firms, and Dr. Chin's story is inspiring a growing movement of doctors who are no longer just using medical devices—they are innovating and owning them.,It began with a simple idea—a better plate and screw system—and an early exposure to SolidWorks that helped Dr. Chin visualize his designs. The X-Plate was his first foray into product development. But it wasn't until he received his first three patents that he realized: protecting ideas was not enough. They had to translate into real products that solved real surgical problems.,That realization led to the MANTIS (Minimal Access Nontraumatic Insertion System) percutaneous pedicle screw. After filing just two patents, interest from Zimmer and Stryker came quickly. MANTIS was ultimately acquired by Stryker before even reaching the market. It was proof that strong intellectual property and clinically relevant innovation could open doors—even for an independent surgeon.,Founded in 2005 as Kingsley Investment Company and evolving into KIC Ventures by 2013, Dr. Chin's vision matured from inventor to investor. KIC Ventures was created to give physicians and engineers a seat at the table. While others chased institutional funding, Dr. Chin raised over , directly from physicians who believed in their collective ability to improve spine care.,At KIC Ventures, every innovation starts with a problem in the OR. Surgeons identify the issue. Engineers bring it to life. Together, they test, iterate, and validate—with IP protection and FDA clearance paving the way. It's a repeatable process rooted in collaboration:,Long before today's medtech startups, surgeon-entrepreneurs like Dr. , laid the foundation for innovation in spine care. A practicing orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Steffee founded , , developed the first pedicle screw system introduced in the U.S., and created the , lumbar disc —the world's first viscoelastic disc replacement.,His vision and persistence not only advanced spine surgery but also proved the value surgeons bring to innovation. In 1998, Dr. Steffee sold , to , for ,, marking one of the most notable physician-led exits in medtech history., – Dr. ,Today, KIC Ventures continues that legacy:,As the medtech world turns toward smart devices and outpatient care, the surgeon-innovator model is more relevant than ever. Dr. Steffee's story proves that when physicians lead innovation, patients benefit—and so does the industry.,The traditional medical device model favored big companies, with surgeons playing a supporting role. KIC Ventures flipped that model. By putting physician-investors in control of design, development, and commercialization, Dr. Chin created a platform where clinical insight drives innovation—not corporate spreadsheets.,Navigating legal scrutiny, anti-kickback concerns, and waves of market consolidation required more than business savvy. It demanded the same grit and discipline that surgeons apply in the OR. That mindset, along with decades of trust built with peers, gave Dr. Chin and his ventures a durable edge.,As KIC Ventures celebrates 20 years and Dr. Chin , years since his first IP filing, the firm is accelerating its focus on smart devices, AI-assisted procedures, and next-generation biomaterials. The goal remains the same: reduce surgical exposure, preserve anatomy, and restore function.,Physicians across the country are realizing they can be more than users—they can be owners and innovators. Dr. Chin's journey shows what's possible when doctors step into the arena, embrace entrepreneurship, and build innovations that serve both their peers and their patients., Dr. , is a ,-trained orthopedic spine surgeon, entrepreneur, and CEO of KIC Ventures.

Rocky Linux 8 and Rocky Linux 9.2 have been officially listed under the NIST Modules in Process (MIP) list following review by our lab partner, atsec. This significant achievement provides organizations an Enterprise Linux distribution with the assurance of a validated security posture for their critical workloads.,
              ,This FIPS 140-3 certification for Rocky Linux 8 and 9 offers several key benefits for organizations:,Compliance, particularly with standards like FIPS 140-3, is a mandatory requirement for a significant portion of enterprises and government agencies. Even for organizations where it is not mandated, achieving this compliance is crucial for building and maintaining customer trust. This compliance provides a valuable option for prospects within these sectors who are already utilizing Enterprise Linux distributions and have limited choices for a compliant operating system.,""FIPS 140-3 certification for a Linux distribution is a significant undertaking, and obtaining this for Rocky Linux 8 and 9 represents a substantial investment of time and effort from our team,"" said ,, CEO and founder of CIQ. ""The process is meticulous, and I am incredibly proud of our work. We are now excited to support both the community-driven Rocky Linux and Rocky Linux from CIQ users. However, our work is just beginning. We will continuously provide updates to ensure all users have a path to ongoing security, and will work to deliver additional compliance with other standards for our customers and the community."",FIPS 140-3 encompasses key cryptographic modules essential for regulated environments, including the kernel, NSS, Libgcrypt, OpenSSL, and GnuTLS. These packages have been updated by CIQ with FIPS-compliant security patches and are a prerequisite for achieving FIPS 140-3 compliance in regulated workloads. When FIPS mode is enabled, strict algorithm restrictions are enforced, adhering to minimum standards for entropy and encryption strength as mandated by FIPS 140-3.,Additionally, the OpenSSL modules in both Rocky 8 and Rocky 9 have been enhanced by CIQ to add full FIPS 140-3 support for the EDDSA-based elliptic curve signing algorithm ED25519 and ED448, which is in addition to the upstream cryptographic support in the open source released versions. The OpenSSL module in Rocky 8 has been enhanced to be fully certified for TLS1.3 in FIPS mode.,""Rocky Linux is deployed massively through organizations that have strict compliance restrictions including the US Government,"" said ,, Compliance and Security Team co-lead of Rocky Linux and CTO of Atomicorp. ""The validation that FIPS provides to the Rocky Linux community is a massive testament to both Rocky Linux as a premier community-based Enterprise Linux operating system as well as CIQ, whose commitment to open source and Rocky Linux is clear. Thank you CIQ for making such an impactful investment to the community and supporting other security focused organizations like Atomicorp."",The FIPS 140-3 standard represents a significant evolution in cryptographic security from FIPS 140-2, imposing stricter algorithmic strength requirements to address increasing processing power and sophistication. Consequently, legacy algorithms with known vulnerabilities or insufficient security margins, such as SHA-1 for digital signatures, RSA keys smaller than 2048 bits, and Triple DES (3DES) encryption, have been deprecated or disallowed.,All of the FIPS work that has been completed by the CIQ team is available as open source in a ,.,Validation details for the Rocky Linux cryptographic modules are publicly available on the NIST website through the following links:,The final CMVP certificate will be accessible in the 'Validated Modules' section of the NIST website upon NIST's completion of the lab report validation in the future., delivers secure and performant software infrastructure for the demands of all modern workloads, from the most mundane to the most extreme HPC and AI jobs. We believe infrastructure should drive the future of your business and that both the operating system of a single machine and the orchestration layer to manage a cluster of machines and even hybrid environments needs to be optimized for your requirements. We are an open source company who has started and/or contributed to critical infrastructure projects such as Rocky Linux, Warewulf, Ascender, and Apptainer. ,Cathey.co for CIQ,SOURCE CIQ"

The first commercial doses were made available on ,.,
              ,Neuraceq® is an FDA-approved radioactive diagnostic agent for the detection of amyloid plaques in the brain of adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive decline. Neuraceq® is used in clinical routine and is also a powerful diagnostic tool for the appropriate characterization of patients assessed for treatment eligibility with newly approved anti-amyloid drugs, or for enrollment in clinical trials to further support drug development in neurodegenerative diseases.,Enhanced the supply capabilities of Neuraceq® to increase patient access to beta-amyloid PET imaging.,""Life Molecular Imaging is pleased to expand the availability of Neuraceq® to ,, enhancing access for patients and imaging centers in this key region. This expansion reflects LMI's commitment to ensuring broad accessibility to Neuraceq®, reinforcing our dedication to supporting a key step on the pathway to treatment,"" said ,, US Country Head and Chief Operating Officer, Americas and APAC.,
               ,Neuraceq® is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate β-amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline. A negative Neuraceq scan indicates sparse to no neuritic plaques and is inconsistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan result reduces the likelihood that a patient's cognitive impairment is due to AD. A positive Neuraceq scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological examination has shown this amount of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with AD, but may also be present in patients with other types of neurologic conditions as well as older people with normal cognition. Neuraceq is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations. ,Errors may occur in the Neuraceq estimation of brain neuritic β-amyloid plaque density during image interpretation. Image interpretation should be performed independently of the patient's clinical information. The use of clinical information in the interpretation of Neuraceq images has not been evaluated and may lead to errors. Errors may also occur in cases with severe brain atrophy that limits the ability to distinguish gray and white matter on the Neuraceq scan. Errors may also occur due to motion artifacts that result in image distortion. Neuraceq scan results are indicative of the presence of brain neuritic β-amyloid plaques only at the time of image acquisition and a negative scan result does not preclude the development of brain neuritic β-amyloid plaques in the future.,Neuraceq, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure., ,The overall safety profile of Neuraceq is based on data from 1,090 administrations of Neuraceq to 872 subjects. No serious adverse reactions related to Neuraceq administration have been reported. The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in subjects receiving Neuraceq were injection site reactions consisting of erythema (1.7%), irritation (1.1%) and pain (3.4%).,For more information please visit: neuraceq.com,Life Molecular Imaging (LMI) is an international pharma company dedicated to developing and offering novel cutting-edge PET radiopharmaceuticals for imaging of neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.
