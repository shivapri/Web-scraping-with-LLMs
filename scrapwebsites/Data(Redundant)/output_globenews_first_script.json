The percentage of people over 60 in the globe will almost double, from 12% to 22%, between 2015 and 2050.\nThe \n stood at USD 31.80 billion in 2024 and is expected to rise from USD 31.80 billion in 2025 USD 44.90 billion by 2034, the market is growing at a CAGR of 3.60% between 2025 and 2034.\ndue to the high incidence of chronic pain, the sophisticated healthcare system, and the existence of large pharmaceutical corporations that are actively involved in the development of pain management medications. Additionally, the growing number of surgical procedures that are needed for post-operative pain treatment is helping the market expand.\nThe market is expanding as a result of the establishment of a strong regulatory environment, rising healthcare costs, and an aging patient population. Furthermore, the growing number of patient education programs and public awareness campaigns on pain management and available treatments is fostering a favorable environment for market expansion.\n. A number of significant variables that highlight the Asia Pacific region's changing healthcare landscape and demographic trends position it for rapid expansion in the worldwide market for pain management medications. Healthcare spending is rising in tandem with Asia Pacific nations' continued development, increasing access to medications, especially painkillers and medical services.\nDemand for cutting-edge healthcare solutions is being driven by urbanization and rising disposable incomes, especially in densely populated nations like China and India, where a burgeoning middle class is looking for improved healthcare alternatives. Furthermore, the Asia Pacific region's aging population is a major factor in the rise in demand for painkillers.\nThe \n segment dominated the pain management drugs market in 2024. Medications like morphine, fentanyl, and tramadol are examples of opioids, which are frequently used to relieve pain. They are used by people who suffer from persistent headaches and backaches, by patients recuperating from surgery or suffering from excruciating pain related to cancer, and by adults and children who have been gravely harmed in falls, car accidents, or other occurrences, or who have been hurt playing sports.\nThe NASAIDs segment is estimated to grow at the fastest rate during the forecast period. A family of drugs known as NSAIDs is used to treat inflammation, fever, and pain. Acute and chronic pain, biliary and ureteric colic, and dysmenorrhea are among the nonrheumatic disorders for which NSAIDs are being used more often.\n Postoperative acute discomfort is not uncommon. In the first 24 hours following surgery, around 20% of patients report experiencing severe pain; this percentage has essentially been constant. One of the main duties of healthcare providers is to prevent and reduce postoperative pain.\nOne of the most prevalent complaints among cancer patients is pain. An individual's quality of life is enhanced when their pain is well managed. Instead of waiting until the pain starts, it is preferable to consistently take the recommended dosages of painkillers.\nThe most prevalent kind of pharmacy that gives the general people access to their prescription drugs and health advice is the community pharmacy, sometimes referred to as a retail pharmacy. Traditionally referred to as a chemist, this healthcare institution is in charge of offering pharmaceutical services to a certain population group or geographic area.\n Due in large part to internet pharmacies' reduced prices, the online drug trade has expanded quickly. The ease of internet pharmacies is one of its benefits. Having a large selection of items at one online store is the nicest thing about \n.\nPain management is an essential part of patient care, and hence, many pharmaceutical companies focus on developing better pain management drugs with few to no side effects. Some of the major companies in the pain management drugs market are \n, an extension was granted to Virpax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company that specializes in the development of drugs for pain treatment, for its research partnership with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). The NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) project is supporting the renewal of the partnership agreement, which is anticipated to strengthen Virpax's pre-clinical and clinical development plans for NES100. The extension of this partnership excites us because we think it might help Virpax create a safe and efficient substitute for traditional opioids, stated Jatinder Dhaliwal, CEO of Virpax Pharmaceuticals.\nNorth America\nAsia Pacific\nEurope\nLatin America\nMiddle East and Africa (MEA)\nPrecedence Research offers exclusive subscription services designed to provide in-depth data and analytics insights.

The presentation will focus on results from its ongoing open-label, randomized Phase I/II study EVICTION, including updated efficacy, safety and dose-selection data on the company’s lead γ9δ2 T-cell activator, ICT01, in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax for the treatment of older or unfit patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n“γ9δ2 T-cell activation with ICT01 combined with azacitidine-venetoclax for older/unfit adults with newly diagnosed AML: Preliminary efficacy and dose selection in phase 1/2 study EVICTION”\nOral Abstract Session S100a - Hematologic Malignancies - Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, and Allotransplant\nMonday, June 2, 2025\n 5:12 p.m.- 5:24 p.m. Central Time\nThe ASCO presentation will be available on ImCheck’s corporate website after the presentation has been held.\n***\nEVICTION is a first-in-human, dose-escalation (Part 1) and cohort-expansion (Part 2) clinical study of ICT01 in patients with various advanced relapsed or refractory solid or hematologic cancers that have exhausted standard-of-care treatment options. Part 1 (Phase I) is designed to characterize the preliminary safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic activity of increasing doses of ICT01 as monotherapy (Group A: solid tumors; Group B: hematologic tumors) and in combination with pembrolizumab (Group C: solid tumors). Part 2 comprises randomized dose-optimizing and efficacy estimating expansion cohorts of monotherapy (Group D: ovarian cancer; Group E: prostate cancer) and combination treatment of patients with AML (Group F), melanoma (Group G), urothelial cell carcinoma (Group H), or head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (Group I). More information on the EVICTION study can be found at \n (NCT04243499).\nICT01 is a humanized, anti-BTN3A (also known as CD277) monoclonal antibody that selectively activates γ9δ2 T cells, which are responsible for immunosurveillance of malignancy and infections. The three isoforms of BTN3A targeted by ICT01 are overexpressed on many solid tumors (e.g., melanoma, urothelial cell, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, and lung cancer) and hematologic malignancies (e.g., leukemia and lymphomas) and also expressed on the surface of innate (e.g., γδ T cells and NK cells) and adaptive immune cells (T cells and B cells). BTN3A is essential for the activation of the anti-tumor immune response of γ9δ2 T cells.\nAs demonstrated by data presented at past AACR, ASCO, ASH, ESMO and SITC conferences, ICT01 selectively activates circulating γ9δ2 T cells leading to migration of γ9δ2 T cells out of the circulation and into the tumor tissue and triggers a downstream immunological cascade through secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including but not limited to IFNγ and TNFα, further augmenting the anti-tumor immune response. Anti-tumor activity and efficacy of ICT01 have been shown in patients across several cancer indications.\nImCheck Therapeutics is developing a new generation of immunotherapeutic antibodies targeting butyrophilins, a novel superfamily of immunomodulators. By unlocking the power of γ9δ2 T cells, ImCheck’s innovative approach has the potential to transform treatments across oncology, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. \nThe lead clinical-stage program, ICT01, has been advancing to late-stage trials, demonstrating a unique mechanism of action that modulates both innate and adaptive immunity. These “first-in-class” activating antibodies may deliver superior clinical outcomes compared to first-generation immunotherapy approaches, in particular in rationale combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors and immunomodulatory anti-cancer drugs. Additionally, ImCheck’s pipeline compounds are progressing toward clinical development for autoimmune and infectious diseases.\nThe company benefits from the pioneering research of Prof. Daniel Olive (INSERM, CNRS, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Aix-Marseille University), a global leader in γ9δ2 T cells and butyrophilins, as well as the expertise of a seasoned management team and the commitment of leading U.S. and European investors.\nGretchen Schweitzer\n+49 (0) 172 861 8540\nCéline Voisin\n+33 (0)6 62 12 53 39\n\n    \n\n", "article_contacts": null, "company_name": null, "company_website": null, "tags": ["/en/search/tag/eviction", "/en/search/tag/aml", "/en/search/tag/γ9δ2", "/en/search/tag/tcell", "/en/search/tag/clinical%2520study", "/en/search/tag/imchecktherapeutics", "/en/search/tag/ict01", "/en/search/tag/immunotherapy", "/en/search/tag/evictionstudy", "/en/search/tag/biotechinnovation", "/en/search/tag/cancerresearch"], "url": "https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/23/3066595/0/en/ImCheck-Announces-Oral-Presentation-of-Updated-ICT01-Efficacy-Data-in-First-line-AML-at-the-ASCO-Annual-Meeting-2025.html"},

These moments are no longer optional—they’re essential.” \nAs budgets tighten and teams shrink, eventgoers are becoming more selective about where they show up. The report also reveals a growing gap between exhibitor expectations and organizer delivery—highlighting the need for smarter, more commerce-focused experiences. \n“The data is clear,” said Dell. “People aren’t going to events to be entertained. They’re going to evaluate, to compare, to decide—and they want experiences that support that journey.” \nThe full report, \n is available for download \n.\nFreeman is a global leader in events, on a mission to redefine live for a new era. With a data-driven approach and the industry’s largest network of experts, Freeman’s insights shape exhibitions, exhibits, and events that drive audiences to action.
