For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Fund, please call (844) 954-5333 or visit our website at www.adrhedged.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your investment in the Series, and the Series performance could trail that of other investments.</i></p> <p><i>Market Risk. The prices of the securities in the Series are subject to the risk associated with investing in the stock market, including sudden and unpredictable drops in value. An investment in the Series may lose money.</i></p> <p><i>Currency Hedging Risk. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect the value of ADRs, the Series enters into the Currency Hedge Contract in order to seek to minimize the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Local Currency. While this approach is designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Series returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Series exposure to the Local Currency. Currency hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the Currency Hedge Contract and the currencies that the contract intends to hedge, and there can be no assurance that the Currency Hedge Contract will be effective. The return of the Currency Hedge Contract will not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations between the Local Currency and the U.S.</i></p> <p><i>Currency Swap Risk. In order to hedge currency risk, the Series enters into a Currency Hedge Contract. The Currency Hedge Contract is subject to market risk, risk of default by the other party to the transaction, known as \"counterparty risk,\" and risk of imperfect correlation between profit or loss on the Currency Hedge Contract and the underlying currency exchange rate.</i></p> <p><i>Issuer Concentration Risk. Because the Series only invests in the ADRs of the Company and the Currency Hedge Contract, the Series may be adversely affected by the performance of the Company, subject to increased price volatility and more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting the Company or industry.</i></p> <p><i>Foreign Market Risk. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Series does not price its Shares, the value of the underlying securities of the ADRs in the Series portfolio may change on days when Shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Series Shares, regardless of whether there is an active U.S. market for Shares.</i></p> <p><i>Non-Diversification Risk. The Series is non-diversified and holds Portfolio Securities of only one particular issuer. As a result, the Series may have greater volatility than other diversified funds.</i></p> <p><i>Management Risk. The Series is subject to the risk that the Manager's investment management strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</i></p> <p><i>New Series Risk.

Incident reports and national data confirm a persistent upward trend in verbal threats, physical assaults, and repeated aggression, particularly in emergency departments and behavioral health units.</p> <p>A new national survey from Black Book Research, conducted among 240 respondents-including emergency department physicians, nurses, hospital-based staff, and 200 healthcare consumers-reveals strong support for immediate legislative action. Key findings include:</p> <p>• 98% of hospital staff and 93% of healthcare consumers support federal legislation mandating workplace violence prevention measures. • 100% of staff report experiencing or witnessing workplace violence, and nearly all believe current safety protocols are inadequate. • 64% have formally documented a violent incident, while 29% often avoid reporting due to fear of retaliation, management inaction, or normalization of violence. • Among healthcare consumers, nearly 90% say violence against providers undermines trust in hospitals and that zero-tolerance policies enhance their confidence in receiving safe care.</p> <p>The survey coincides with growing momentum behind H.R. 2663, the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act. This legislation mandates that OSHA establish a national standard, compelling healthcare employers to implement advanced workplace violence prevention frameworks, execute ongoing risk assessments, provide cutting-edge training in conflict de-escalation techniques, ensure accessible and secure incident reporting mechanisms, and engage frontline staff directly in safety protocols. Despite strong bipartisan backing and overwhelming public endorsement, the bill remains stalled in the House Subcommittee on Work and Welfare, hindered by procedural complexities and competing legislative priorities.</p> <p>Respondents also highlighted critical technological and organizational strategies to curb hospital workplace violence effectively:</p> <p>• Deployment of comprehensive, high-tech security infrastructure including advanced panic alarms, AI-enhanced video surveillance systems, and sophisticated controlled-access technologies • Enforcement of digitally integrated zero-tolerance policies, streamlined reporting platforms, and robust accountability measures • Implementation of rapid-response Behavioral Emergency Response Teams (BERTs) utilizing real-time communication and location-tracking technologies • Advanced mental health and trauma support solutions leveraging telehealth platforms and predictive analytics to proactively identify and support at-risk staff</p> <p>Technology vendors are supporting these safety efforts by deploying real-time response tools and proactive risk management solutions. Their innovations are aligning closely with the objectives of H.R. 2663, demonstrating how healthcare IT can serve as a frontline defense against violence in clinical settings.</p> <p>\"Technology is now a cornerstone of prevention strategies in hospital safety plans,\" said Doug Brown, Founder of Black Book Research. \"Healthcare IT vendors play a vital role in safeguarding hospital staff by embedding safety-focused features into the software and services used every day. From predictive analytics that flag potential escalation risks to integrated real-time alert systems and AI-driven surveillance, these technologies are no longer optional-they are essential tools in the fight to reduce workplace violence and prevent injuries.\"</p> <p><strong>EHR-Integrated Safety Solutions:</strong></p> <p>• <strong>Epic Systems:</strong> Integrates risk flags and behavioral alerts directly into clinical workflows to proactively address potential threats, enabling quicker identification and management of violent behaviors. • <strong>Oracle Health:</strong> Offers patient behavior history tracking and comprehensive staff safety tools, enabling proactive management of high-risk scenarios to mitigate potential threats. • <strong>MEDITECH:</strong> Embeds staff communication tools and risk alerts within its EHR, streamlining real-time communication and responses to safety incidents, promoting rapid coordination. • <strong>Qualifacts:</strong> Provides real-time emergency department coordination and notifications, improving situational awareness and effective response during incidents. • <strong>Commure:</strong> Uses AI-powered threat response integrated with EHRs, automating detection and management of threats to reduce staff burnout and violence risks. • <strong>RLDatix:</strong> Specializes in comprehensive incident reporting, risk management, and proactive safety alerts, efficiently managing incidents and enhancing frontline staff safety.</p> <p><strong>AI-Driven Monitoring and Escalation Detection Systems:</strong></p> <p>• <strong>Vocera (Stryker):</strong> Wearable technology provides real-time situational awareness, immediate alerts, and precise location tracking, ensuring swift response to threats. • <strong>Wobot Intelligence:</strong> AI-enhanced video analytics detect abnormal behaviors in real-time, instantly alerting security personnel. • <strong>Care.ai:</strong> Ambient monitoring solutions use predictive analytics to identify early aggression, enabling early intervention. • <strong>RevealDx:</strong> AI-based behavior analytics integrated with security systems for continuous monitoring and real-time threat identification. • <strong>CENTEGIX:</strong> Wearable duress buttons provide instant alerts and precise locations, significantly reducing response times. • <strong>Cognosos:</strong> Real-time location systems (RTLS) continuously track staff and equipment, enhancing emergency responses. • <strong>Scylla:</strong> AI-powered video threat analytics integrate with existing surveillance, providing instant threat detection and response capabilities. • <strong>Oddity.ai:</strong> Specialized video violence detection seamlessly integrates with security infrastructure for immediate incident response. • <strong>Valiance Solutions (HospitalGuard AI):</strong> Real-time threat detection using advanced AI algorithms to continuously monitor and address security risks. • <strong>IntelliSee:</strong> AI-powered monitoring proactively detects threats and provides actionable alerts for swift security intervention.</p> <p><strong>Audio Analytics and Real-Time Alerts:</strong></p> <p>• <strong>Security 101:</strong> Advanced audio analytics detect verbal aggression, gunshots, and alarming sounds, instantly alerting security teams.</p> <p><strong>Predictive Analytics and Training Tools:</strong></p> <p>• <strong>American Medical Compliance (AMC):</strong> Online training modules and virtual reality programs designed specifically to help healthcare workers effectively recognize, manage, and respond to workplace violence, significantly enhancing preparedness and resilience.</p> <p>As bipartisan momentum builds, the healthcare community is calling on Congress to advance H.R. 2663 without further delay.

The full report, including the complete dataset, detailed segment analysis, and additional forecasts, is now available for download at the Black Book website for the spectrum of healthcare and medical managed services vendors.</p> <p>The current report underscores how healthcare outsourcing is becoming a strategic necessity-driven by critical workforce shortages, accelerating digital transformation, payer complexity, and rising costs. The research evaluates outsourcing across core segments including revenue cycle management (RCM), IT services, clinical operations, pharmacy, imaging, emergency services, and remote monitoring.</p> <p><i><strong>Key Findings from the Report</strong></i></p> <p><strong>Market Growth</strong>: U.S. healthcare outsourcing is projected to grow from $366.6 billion in 2025 to $662 billion by 2028, at a 21.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). The U.S. BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) segment alone is forecasted to reach $151.2 billion in 2025.</p> <p><strong>Growth Drivers</strong>: Workforce shortages, financial pressures, modernization of IT infrastructure, and a post-pandemic shift to virtual services are fueling adoption.</p> <p><strong>Fastest-Growing Segments</strong>: RCM, medical billing, healthcare IT outsourcing, and clinical documentation support are among the top expanding categories, with CAGRs ranging from 6.2% to 15.3%.</p> <p><i><strong>Strategic Insights for Providers, Payers, and Public Health Agencies</strong></i></p> <p>The report outlines how healthcare entities are leaning into outsourcing for both strategic advantage and operational continuity:</p> <p><strong>Healthcare Providers</strong> are increasingly outsourcing RCM, IT, virtual care, and patient access support-particularly mid-sized hospitals, rural systems, and specialty practices.</p> <p><strong>Health Plans and Payers</strong> are leveraging outsourcing for utilization management, analytics, and member engagement to enhance performance in value-based care models.</p> <p><strong>Government Agencies</strong> are modernizing infrastructure and reducing costs through outsourced solutions to meet growing public health demands.</p> <p><i><strong>Segment Highlights</strong></i></p> <p><strong>Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)</strong>: Market size projected to grow from $34.7 billion in 2025 to $51.8 billion by 2028 (14.3% CAGR), with providers aiming to improve collections and streamline reimbursement complexity. Black Book is publishing its annual \"Black Book of Revenue Cycle Management Solutions\" report next week in a separate one hundred page comprehensive resource.</p> <p><strong>Medical Billing Outsourcing</strong>: Expected to climb from $19.3 billion to $29.8 billion by 2028 (15.3% CAGR), driven by solo practices and specialty clinics adapting to increasing coding and billing complexity.</p> <p><strong>Healthcare IT Outsourcing</strong>: On track to reach $80.2 billion by 2028, with major investment areas in cloud services, cybersecurity, and data <strong>interoperability.</strong></p> <p><strong>Healthcare Services Outsourcing: </strong>The largest and most rapidly growing segment, forecasted to expand from $152.5 billion in 2025 to $217.9 billion by 2028 (12.6% CAGR), encompassing clinical documentation, patient access, and virtual staffing solutions.</p> <p><i><strong>Recent Developments in Healthcare Outsourcing</strong></i></p> <p><strong>Hospital Outsourcing Market Expansion</strong>: Hospitals globally are increasingly turning to external partners for non-core functions such as facilities management, medical billing, and IT to refocus resources on patient care.</p> <p><strong>Surge in Healthcare M&amp;A Activity</strong>: The payer outsourcing market is undergoing significant transformation due to a spike in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity. This consolidation is reshaping competitive dynamics, enhancing scale and service breadth, and aligning outsourcing vendors more closely with payer strategic goals. M&amp;A momentum is expected to intensify in 2025, particularly among vendors specializing in analytics, member services, and population health management.</p> <p><i><strong>The Future of Healthcare Outsourcing</strong></i></p> <p>According to Black Book's analysis, outsourcing is evolving from a cost-saving measure to a core operational and strategic pillar in healthcare. As the industry grapples with persistent labor shortages, inflationary pressure, and rising operational complexity, outsourcing partners are being redefined not only as vendors-but as essential infrastructure for scale, resilience, and digital-first patient engagement.</p> <p><strong>Download the full April 2025 report and access the expanded dataset now at</strong>:<br><a href=\"https://stats.nwe.io/x/html?final=aHR0cHM6Ly9ibGFja2Jvb2ttYXJrZXRyZXNlYXJjaC5jb20vdGhlLXJhcGlkLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1vZi1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLWluZHVzdHJ5LW91dHNvdXJjaW5n&amp;sig=2Fqt4h7gUV5Z1gks2yxiRKkU_Hcr2a7-Sj22_U98JloznpNGjfBKELcPsLq2LihKXQf3P6K7luw_hGDiujbp_g&amp;hit%2Csum=WyI0dWppM2EiLCI0dWppM2IiLCI0dWppM2MiXQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://blackbookmarketresearch.com/the-rapid-expansion-of-healthcare-industry-outsourcing</a></p> <p><strong>The list of top-rated Managed Services and Outsourcing Vendors is available at</strong>:<br><a href=\"https://stats.nwe.io/x/html?final=aHR0cHM6Ly9ibGFja2Jvb2ttYXJrZXRyZXNlYXJjaC5jb20vb3V0c291cmNpbmctYW5kLW1hbmFnZWQtc2VydmljZXM&amp;sig=ooDSdUNEGMrmKC3ec1byXeQNY7xnK10wXT2QwWnWZX4sMfo8ZOdW6UkkGopUaj9sLi94s44gfW8ThbgO16FhUQ&amp;hit%2Csum=WyI0dWppM2QiLCI0dWppM2UiLCI0dWppM2MiXQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://blackbookmarketresearch.com/outsourcing-and-managed-services</a></p> <p><strong>About Black Book Research</strong></p> <p>Black Book Research was founded by Doug Brown, author of the bestselling <i>The Black Book of Outsourcing</i> (Wiley, 2005, 2010), the first definitive guide to offshore and domestic outsourcing across industries such as business process management, financial services, legal, engineering, and IT.

Designed natively on the HubSpot platform, MAP makes it easy for nonprofits to launch quickly and connect their data, fundraising, marketing, and key integrations with real-time intelligence and flexibility.</p> <p>\"This is not just another product - it's an ecosystem. MAP is about aligning the most powerful commercial technology with the real needs of nonprofits,\" said Tracy Kronzak, Chief Strategy Officer of Benevolent Tech. \"It's moving away from the ‘centralize everything in CRM' approach, and replacing it with tools and partnerships that are contextual, cooperative, and grounded in the ways nonprofit teams actually work.\"</p> <p><strong>An Ecosystem of Integrated Partners</strong></p> <p>The launch of MAP is supported by mission-aligned partners extending the value of HubSpot, including Fundraise Up, Postalytics, event•hapily, and more. Together, this community of partners provides online fundraising, direct mail, and event management - all integrated into the HubSpot experience.</p> <p>\"We're thrilled to be launching the Mission Action Pack at the 2025 Nonprofit Technology Conference #25NTC - there's no better place to celebrate the nonprofit community and the innovative work that drives it forward,\" said Amy Rose, co-CEO at Benevolent Tech. \"This launch isn't just about a new product; it's about an ecosystem coming together to solve real problems with real solutions. By championing flexible, interoperable tools through trusted partnerships, we're helping nonprofits build the tech stacks that actually work for them - at a fraction of the cost and complexity of legacy platforms.\"</p> <p>Additionally, the next-generation of capabilities are forthcoming through MAP &amp; HubSpot integrations already underway, including capabilities for payment processing, data enrichment, impact measurement, case management, advocacy and online engagement tools, and donor analytics and segmentation, allowing nonprofits to select what technology they need, when they need it.</p> <p><strong>A New Era for Mission-Driven Tech</strong></p> <p>Nonprofits today face increasing pressure to do more with less, and traditional CRMs - once touted as the \"single source of truth\" - are now falling short. MAP is the answer to this shift: a scalable, human-centered solution that's easy to adopt, integrate, and use.</p> <p>\"MAP isn't just about systems and software - it's about people,\" said Brian Greenwald, co-CEO at Benevolent Tech. \"When we bring together the right tools, partners, and strategies, we create space for nonprofit teams to feel empowered. This collaboration is about increasing wellbeing, fulfillment, and agency for the people creating benevolence in the world - because when the tech gets out of the way, people can show up fully and be the best version of themselves for the causes they care about.\"</p> <p>Mission Action Pack is available now.

Designed for real-world logistics, this breakthrough EV truck features an impressive <strong>420-mile range</strong> and is now set for commercial deployment in the United States.</p> <p>This milestone is being realized in partnership with <strong>JoyRide Logistics</strong>, a Phoenix-based carrier and the <strong>first U.S. regional trucking company</strong> to operate fully electric sleeper trucks, all of which will be powered by EO Charging, a global pioneer in Electric Charging (EV) solutions for mission critical depot-based fleets. The initial rollout begins in <strong>Arizona, California and Nevada</strong>, with nationwide expansion in sight.</p> <p>\"This isn't just a prototype or promise-this is a fully operational, long-range electric truck that's ready to haul freight today,\" said <strong>Wen Han</strong>, founder, chairman, and CEO of Windrose. \"We've validated our technology globally and are proud to bring it to the U.S.-one of the most important logistics markets in the world.\"</p> <p><strong>The First True Long-Haul EV Sleeper Truck</strong></p> <p>Windrose trucks have undergone extensive real-world testing across <strong>Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North America</strong>. In a recent U.S. field test, the Windrose sleeper completed a <strong>2,800-mile</strong> cross-country trip using only <strong>public charging stations. Further Windrose also completed a 3,000+ mile loaded trip shipping clothing from the Hong Kong area to the China-Kazakhstan border</strong>-a clear demonstration of its range, reliability, and charging compatibility.</p> <p>Built for full-length hauls with 420 miles of range, the Windrose electric sleeper includes a comfortable bunk area, fast-charging capabilities (MCS &amp; CCS), and over 700kWh of battery offering with both LFP and NMC battery types, all while maintaining Class 8 performance standards and weighing under 26,000 lbs.</p> <p><strong>JoyRide Logistics: Driving the Shift in Regional Freight</strong></p> <p><strong>JoyRide Logistics</strong>, an expanding regional carrier with a fleet of over 250 trucks operating in six states, is leading the adoption of electric long-haul trucks in the U.S. By deploying Windrose EV sleepers, JoyRide aligns with its mission to meet-and help shape-customers' evolving sustainability goals.</p> <p>\"Partnering with Windrose allows us to stay ahead-not just on sustainability, but on total operational performance,\" said <strong>Adis Danan</strong>, President at JoyRide Logistics. \"We're talking fuel savings, reduced maintenance, and a future-ready fleet that our customers can get behind. We want to make electric logistics efficient, scalable-and cool.\"</p> <p>JoyRide already partners with multiple <strong>Fortune 500 customers</strong>, many of whom are actively working to reduce Scope 3 emissions. The integration of EV's into their fleet is a direct response to those sustainability benchmarks.</p> <p><strong>EO Charging: Infrastructure Built for Fleet Scale</strong></p> <p>Powering the rollout is <strong>EO Charging</strong>, a global pioneer in Electric Charging (EV) solutions for mission critical depot-based fleets. Their solution leverages real-estate acquisition, charging infrastructure deployment and vehicle financing, plus their unique &gt;99% uptime promise, to help deliver a cost-competitive service for Shippers.</p> <p><i>\"Together, Windrose, JoyRide and EO Charging are making electrified long-haul freight a reality-not years from now, but today,\" said Charlie Jardine, President and Founder at EO Charging. \"We're proud to support this shift with innovative infrastructure solutions designed to optimize costs and help customers reach diesel parity.\"</i></p> <p><strong>Pioneering A Defining Moment for American Trucking</strong></p> <p>With or without regulation, the shift toward electrification is being led by forward-thinking companies. Windrose, JoyRide, and EO Charging are proving that zero-emission trucking can meet performance, efficiency, and customer-driven sustainability goals now-not someday.</p> <p>With the <strong>420-mile all-electric sleeper truck already in operation</strong>, Windrose stands as both a global innovator and a practical solution provider for the future of freight.</p> <p>Exciting times ahead for the trucking business, and the transportation industry as a whole, led by a pioneering group of companies, Windrose Technology, JoyRide Logistics, and EO Charging.</p> <p><strong>About Windrose Technology</strong></p> <p>Based in Antwerp, Belgium, Windrose Technology is a world-leading developer of zero-emission long-haul trucks.

Interviews with 203 Brazilian hospital and physician organizations and 24 government healthcare IT policy officials revealed a complex mix of optimism and concern regarding digital healthcare initiatives.</p> <p><strong>Market Growth Fueled by Urban Centers</strong></p> <p>Brazil's EHR market, currently valued at approximately $1.5 billion, is expected to rise to $2.0 billion by 2030, representing a 5.0% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). However, the research highlighted that growth is predominantly concentrated in major urban centers and larger hospital networks, where 36% of respondents reported significant investments in advanced digital health tools like telemedicine and AI-based diagnostics.</p> <p><strong>Regulatory Progress and Persistent Gaps</strong></p> <p>While Brazil is progressively aligning its regulatory framework with international standards, critical gaps remain. Fully, 100% of government officials surveyed acknowledged the fragmented oversight due to the absence of a centralized digital health authority. The General Data Protection Law (LGPD), although instrumental in enhancing data security, adds complexity, with 96% of providers expressing concerns about compliance and its impacts on operations.</p> <p>The SUS Digital Programme, implemented by all Brazilian states and 70% of municipalities, was cited by 79% of respondents as a positive step toward national digital integration, though its effectiveness remains inconsistent due to varying levels of infrastructure readiness.</p> <p>Several key challenges were identified in the survey:</p> <p><strong>Financial Limitations:</strong> 96% of healthcare providers cited insufficient funding as the primary obstacle, disproportionately impacting smaller hospitals and rural clinics.</p> <p><strong>Workforce Resistance:</strong> Approximately 88% of respondents faced significant resistance from clinical staff, exacerbated by inadequate training programs and a shortage of IT professionals.</p> <p><strong>Interoperability Issues:</strong> 97% of smaller healthcare facilities lacked the necessary technology to participate effectively in national interoperability initiatives, severely limiting data exchange capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Vendor Successes and Market Dynamics</strong></p> <p>Respondents identified several leading EHR vendors successfully navigating Brazil's healthcare market:</p> <p><strong>MV Sistemas:</strong> Reported by 68% of respondents as the most adaptable local solution across diverse healthcare settings.</p> <p><strong>Philips Tasy:</strong> Cited by 63% for strong integration and functionality, particularly in large hospitals.</p> <p><strong>Totvs:</strong> Gained recognition from 57% of mid-sized providers for affordability and compliance features.</p> <p><strong>Oracle Cerner:</strong> International vendor noted by 49% of respondents for robust interoperability solutions tailored to Brazil's healthcare complexities.</p> <p>Emerging local vendors such as Medcloud and Clinica do Futuro were praised by just over half of ambulatory care providers for their intuitive interfaces and efficient LGPD compliance.</p> <p>\"Brazil's journey toward comprehensive digital healthcare is at a pivotal point,\" said Doug Brown, Founder of Black Book. \"Our research shows clear enthusiasm among Brazilian healthcare leaders and policymakers, yet significant barriers remain.

In exchange, Moolec will issue a combination of up to 87 million newly issued shares and 5 million warrants to the shareholders of the Contributed Entities, as more fully described below in the Timing and Approvals section.</p> <p>Federico Trucco, Bioceres Group's board member and CEO of Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp commented: <i>\"The need to accelerate agricultural innovation to address current and future challenges, such as enhancing on-farm profitability and reducing environmental impact, is increasingly evident. Molecular farming, as exemplified by Moolec Science, offers a compelling solution to the challenge of balancing productivity and sustainability. For instance, what soybean yield technology can rival the direct production of 300kg of animal protein from a 3-ton-per-hectare crop?\" </i>He then finished:<i> \"Moolec's recent transformational transaction represents the kind of bold action needed to drive radical change in agriculture. Integrating technologies and capabilities, along with a holistic perspective on agricultural evolution, are essential for moving beyond incremental improvements. Scale and visibility, both of which are key aspects of this transaction, are crucial to achieving this goal. Bioceres is enthusiastic to be part of a larger, more ambitious Moolec, one that expands its focus from science in food ingredients to a comprehensive ‘cradle-to-cradle' approach.\"</i></p> <p>Juan Sartori, Founder and Chairman of Union Group remarked: <i>\"This is not just a strategic alignment of businesses, it's the creation of a new kind of company for the 21st century. By combining science, scale, and sustainability, Moolec is positioned to lead a global transformation in how we produce food, materials, and energy. I'm proud to support this vision and the exceptional teams bringing it to life.\"</i></p> <p>Following the closing of the Business Combination, Moolec will become uniquely positioned in the agricultural value-chain, with a powerful and validated technology discovery and development engine that can address in a cost-competitive way multiple upstream and downstream needs. Moolec's new value proposition will be centered around modifying or improving seeds and microbes to positively impact the way we utilize land and water resources, while preserving and/or improving human health.</p> <p>Alejandro Antalich, Chairman of Synbio Powerlabs® added: <i>\"This combination marks a defining moment for the bioeconomy. By integrating next-gen ingredients, biological ag solutions, and deep-tech manufacturing capabilities under one roof, we are building a company with unmatched scientific depth and commercial reach. Together, we aim to accelerate the shift toward a more sustainable and resilient food system, one that works in harmony with nature, rather than against it.\"</i></p> <p>As stated in their most recent annual reports, the companies and brands, which will be controlled or co-controlled by Moolec at the closing of the Business Combination, manage a portfolio of more than 800 patents (or patent applications) and over 550 product registrations, which translates into more than half a billion dollars of goods and services sold in their last fiscal year, to customers in more than 50 different countries.</p> <p>José López Lecube, CFO and Director of Moolec commented: <i>\"This transformative transaction marks a new stage for Moolec, positioning the company for growth within a broader organization that facilitates synergies on multiple levels. Becoming part of a larger organization will enable cost efficiencies and significant revenue increase as well as product portfolio diversification. It will also enlarge our investor base, providing the company with new stakeholders who support Moolec's new and more diversified business.\"</i></p> <p>Finally, as reported Mr. Gastón Paladini will step down as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Director and Chairman of the Board, effective immediately following Moolec's Extraordinary General Meeting (\"EGM\") to be held on April 22, 2025.</p> <p>Key highlights:</p> <p><strong>Ingredient Innovation:</strong> Moolec will continue to develop its flagship molecular farming products such as <strong>Piggy Sooy™</strong> and <strong>GLASO™</strong>, while integrating <strong>Mycofood™</strong> under the <strong>Eternal®</strong> brand from Nutrecon.</p> <p><strong>Biological Ag Expansion:</strong> Through Bioceres Group, Moolec will now offer upstream technologies for regenerative agriculture, including biological inputs and climate-resilient seeds like <strong>Rizobacter®</strong>, <strong>ProFarm®</strong>, and the <strong>HB4® trait</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Advanced R&amp;D and Services:</strong> Leveraging expanded infrastructure, Moolec will offer R&amp;D, CDMO, and regulatory services under the <strong>Agrality®</strong> and <strong>Synbio Powerlabs®</strong> brands, which are controlled or co-controlled by Bioceres Group and Nutrecon, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Emerging Tech &amp; Equipment:</strong> The Company will also expand its reach into emerging technologies for grain and biomass transformation, especially in the biomaterials space, as well as new concepts on farm equipment, integrating material science, electric mobility, and autonomy. These emerging opportunities are being pursued by Gentle Tech and Bioceres Group subsidiaries.</p> <p><strong>Operational Synergies: </strong>The Business Combination is expected to result in significant cost synergies and an integrated management structure, which will be presented at or prior to closing of the Business Combination.</p> <p><strong>Timing and Approvals</strong></p> <p>The Business Combination was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of all the entities participating in the deal. It is expected to close during the second quarter of 2025 or thereafter, and it is subject to finalizing Moolec's reverse stock split process and re-domicile to the Cayman Islands among other customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. This includes the approval by Moolec's shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders of proposals relating to the Business Combination. Given that the transaction was originally proposed by about 70% of Moolec's current shareholders, the Company expects strong shareholder support for the Business Combination approval.</p> <p>The Business Combination will be consummated through an equity exchange. Bioceres Group's shareholders will surrender their share ownership in Bioceres Group and will receive in exchange up to 80,590,280 shares of Moolec. The shareholders of 100% of Nutrecon and 50% of Gentle Tech will surrender their ownership in these two entities and will receive in exchange 6,475,000 shares of Moolec and 5,000,000 warrants of Moolec at a strike price of $2.00 per warrant, subject to adjustment based on the results of the reverse stock split process.</p> <p>The intrinsic value of the exchange ratio and the $2 strike price of warrants represent both a compelling premium to Moolec's current stock price, and a unique opportunity to assemble one of the most formidable public companies in the agricultural industry.</p> <p><strong>Description of Contributed Entities and Assets</strong></p> <p>The Contributed Entities consist of Bioceres Group and its subsidiaries, Nutrecon and its subsidiaries and Gentle Tech and its subsidiaries.</p> <p><strong><u>Bioceres Group</u></strong></p> <p><strong>Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp.

This significant release harnesses the power of advanced agentic AI to provide autonomous threat detection, analysis, and response, dramatically reducing alert fatigue, accelerating incident response, and enabling security teams to proactively combat evolving cyber threats with unparalleled efficiency.</p> <p>Today's Security Operations Centers (SOCs) face an unprecedented challenge: managing the sheer volume and complexity of cyber threats. Security teams are often overwhelmed by a deluge of alerts from disparate security tools, leading to alert fatigue and delayed responses to critical incidents. According to <a href=\"https://stats.nwe.io/x/html?final=aHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY29tbXVuaXR5Lm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vYmxvZy9taWNyb3NvZnR0aHJlYXRwcm90ZWN0aW9uYmxvZy9jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LWluY2lkZW50LWNvcnJlbGF0aW9uLWluLXRoZS11bmlmaWVkLXNlY3VyaXR5LW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtcGxhdGZvcm0vNDIxNDM5NA&amp;sig=WLvJhfNDTNchMIvQVTZ-ergInZH-5fgozDN05ANrNiTKaBir69B976NvFSxcfwrvzOmP3Q1E2esU7y39D8RECQ&amp;hit%2Csum=WyI0dmF0ZzUiLCI0dmF0ZzYiLCI0dmF0ZzQiXQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Microsoft</u></a>, security analysts spend a significant portion of their time - nearly three hours daily - manually triaging security alerts, a large portion of which turn out to be false positives. This highlights the critical need for more efficient and intelligent threat management solutions.</p> <p>The COGNNA Nexus platform, showcased at RSA 2025, allows organizations to shift from reactive to proactive security measures by integrating deep telemetry, real-time detection, advanced threat hunting, autonomous investigation, proactive threat intelligence, and guided response into a single workflow.

The Bank's earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 resulted in a 10.0% return on equity capital and 0.93% return on assets. The Bank's book value per share rose to $345 as of March 31, 2025 from $299 per share as of March 31, 2024.</p> <p>Significant items impacting quarterly net income for March 31, 2025 and 2024 include the following:</p> <p>Higher loan balances - Average loan outstandings for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 were $580 million higher than the same period prior year, thereby increasing interest income from loans despite a 0.24% decrease in loan yields to 5.38% (including the impact of fair value hedges) compared to the same period in 2024.</p> <p>Deposit growth - Average deposits grew by $221 million compared to the same period in the prior year, partially supporting the Bank's loan growth, with the remainder financed via reducing excess cash balances. Cost of funds decreased by 0.19% to 2.91% from the same period in 2024.</p> <p>The Bank recognized a $5.1 million reduction to income related to free-standing interest rate swaps during the current quarter compared to $6.5 million increase to income in the prior year quarter, or a variance of $11.6 million when comparing the two periods. The current quarter impact is made up of a mark-to-market loss of $6.4 million, partially offset by $1.3 million in net payments received from swap counterparties. These swaps were entered into for the purpose of hedging the medium-term fixed rate loans in the Bank's loan portfolio, as part of the Bank's standard interest rate risk management program. Until these interest rate swaps are designated as a hedge to specific assets or liabilities, the mark-to-market fluctuations (positive and negative) will flow through the income statement.</p> <p>The provision for credit losses for the current quarter was a reversal of $0.1 million compared to an addition of $4.0 million for the prior year quarter. The Bank had zero non-performing loans as of March 31, 2025, and the Bank's Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans was 2.36% of Gross Loans as of March 31, 2025.</p> <p>\"The Bank continues to perform at a high level. The decrease in earnings vs. the prior year period is primarily a function of the accounting for a small portion of our interest rate swap portfolio. All our swaps have been executed to hedge our interest rate risk - none are for speculative purposes. As such, short-term mark-to-market gains and losses in the portfolio are not reflective of the long-term benefit to our balance sheet position,\" said Steve Fleming, president and chief executive officer. \"Our loan quality remains pristine with virtually no delinquencies or non-performing loans. We will remain diligent with our credit monitoring related to potential impacts in the office segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio and continue to help our commercial customers manage their businesses in the face of economic uncertainty.\"</p> <p>\"The Bank's high quality investment securities portfolio continues to perform well with relatively small unrealized losses of less than 1.0% and there are no investment securities categorized as held-to-maturity,\" said Brian Killeen, chief financial officer of River City Bank. \"Operational efficiency remains a core competency for the Bank, as evidenced by our 39% efficiency ratio for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.\"</p> <p>Shareholders' equity for River City Bank on March 31, 2025 increased $13 million to $498 million when compared to the $485 million as of December 31, 2024. The increase was driven by current year retained earnings and an increase in the value of the investment portfolio. The Bank's capital ratios remain healthy and well above the regulatory definition for being Well Capitalized with a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 9.3% as of March 31, 2025.</p> <p>Additionally, Mr. Fleming announced that the Bank's board of directors has approved a cash dividend of $0.40 per common share to shareholders of record as of May 6, 2025, and payable on May 20, 2025.</p> <p><strong>Related File: </strong><a href=\"https://stats.nwe.io/x/html?final=aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4ubndlLmlvL2ZpbGVzL3gvOGYvYjMvN2U2MTk3N2QzZTBjZmVhNTZkNGZjY2U4YTIzMi5wZGY&amp;sig=s6P3YwYLN2VxZJU5xfWojXVFIdRyWpaD0-1qOcOgVL-bXVmj2ppIf25a7L7bbxqet8KJCnglG07v2bPCcHSqHg&amp;hit%2Csum=WyI0dmpxcXAiLCI0dmpxcXEiLCI0djh6dG4iXQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Q1 2025 earnings</a></p> <p><strong>ABOUT RIVER CITY BANK:</strong></p> <p>Named one of <i>Sacramento Business Journal</i>'s \"50 Fastest Growing Companies\" for each of the past seven years, River City Bank is a leading boutique commercial bank throughout California with assets of over $5.2 billion.

Leveraging multi-omics technologies - including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics- and processing this unique dataset with cutting age AI analysis, the project will integrate data from human supercentenarians and exceptionally long-lived mammalian species, representing one of the most comprehensive efforts in aging science to date.</p> <p><strong>A World-Class Alliance</strong></p> <p>This collaborative network unites Matter Bio's research and development capabilities with premier scientists from top institutions dedicated to uncovering the foundations of healthy aging, including:</p> <p><strong>George Church, Ph.D.</strong> (Harvard and MIT)<br><i>Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School</i></p> <p><strong>Nir Barzilai, M.D.</strong> (Albert Einstein College of Medicine)<br><i>Director of the Institute for Aging Research</i></p> <p><strong>Jan Vijg, Ph.D.</strong> (Albert Einstein College of Medicine)<br><i>Professor and Chairman of the Department of Genetics.</i></p> <p><strong>Vera Gorbunova, Ph.D.</strong> (University of Rochester)<br><i>Co-director of the Rochester Aging Research Center</i></p> <p><strong>Yousin Suh, Ph.D.</strong> (Columbia University)<br><i>Director of Reproductive Aging and Chaired Professor</i></p> <p><strong>Paul Robbins, Ph.D.</strong> (University of Minnesota)<br><i>Co-Director of the Institute on the Biology of Aging and Metabolism (iBAM)</i></p> <p><strong>Laura Niedernhofer, M.D., Ph.D.</strong> (University of Minnesota)<br><i>Co-Director of the Institute on the Biology of Aging and Metabolism (iBAM)</i></p> <p>Additional collaborators include experts affiliated with the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR).</p> <p>Decades of research have shown a striking correlation: species with extended lifespans consistently exhibit superior genome stability, resulting not only in longer life, but also in drastically reduced rates of cancer and other age-related diseases. This project aims to build on those findings at an unprecedented scale.</p> <p>\"At Matter Bio, we're determined to shift the paradigm from disease treatment to preventative health solutions that can significantly extend the healthy human lifespan,\" said Chris Bradley, M.S., CEO of Matter Bio. \"This collaboration brings together extraordinary expertise to drive one of the most comprehensive efforts in longevity science ever undertaken.\"</p> <p>The consortium will analyze biological data from over 10,000 human centenarians, 20,000 members of their families and will compare these sequences against over 200,000 regular human genome sequences. This data will be analyzed alongside samples from a combination of more than 300 long-lived and short-lived animal species, including the Greenland Shark, thought to be capable of living over 400 years. Multiple tissues and sample types will be studied for each species, generating tens of thousands of data points for the largest comparative analysis of its kind.</p> <p>By systematically comparing long-lived organisms to shorter-lived controls, the research team aims to identify key pro-longevity genes and molecular pathways. These findings will serve as a powerful foundation for developing targeted therapeutics and interventions to extend healthspan and combat age-related diseases.</p> <p>\"By uniting large-scale genomic data, powerful computational tools, and advanced gene delivery platforms, we have a rare opportunity to intervene in aging processes in ways never before possible,\" said Harvard geneticist and co-founder of Matter Bio, Dr. George Church.</p> <p>The initiative also benefits from the expertise of pioneers in aging research. Nir Barzilai, M.D., of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, noted, \"Centenarians have a longer health-span and a compression of morbidity rooted in their genetics that slows their aging. Several drugs have been developed in part from data collected from the initial studies (Merck and Ionis). This is an ongoing project, and the team has been working together to prove the concept for this accelerated phase.\"</p> <p>Jan Vijg, Ph.D., also of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, added, \"Pinpointing the genetic signatures that drive longevity is one of the greatest challenges in modern science. Working with Matter Bio to conduct comprehensive multi-omics analysis brings us closer than ever to unraveling these complexities.\"</p> <p>\"Joining forces with Matter Bio will help transition fundamental discoveries in aging research into real-world gene therapies,\" said Vera Gorbunova, Ph.D., of the University of Rochester. \"I'm excited about the potential to address the root causes of aging rather than simply tackling diseases after they occur.\"</p> <p>This ambitious initiative represents a major leap forward in actionable longevity science - with the potential to reshape the future of medicine and public health for generations to come.</p> <p><strong>About Matter Bio</strong></p> <p>Matter Bio is a biotechnology company at the forefront of longevity science, committed to extending human healthspan by enhancing genomic resilience and unlocking the genetic keys to healthy aging. Our platform harnesses naturally occurring DNA stability variants and delivers them to human cells to dramatically enhance cellular longevity. When cancer is already present, Matter is delivering engineered bacteria to find and kill tumor cells and these efforts are now entering human clinical trials.
