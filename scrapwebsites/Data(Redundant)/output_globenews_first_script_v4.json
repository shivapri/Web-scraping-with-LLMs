(c) sold shares of Cerevel stock contemporaneously with Bain Capital’s purchase of shares on or about October 16, 2023.\nAccording to the complaint, Cerevel’s October 16, 2023 secondary stock offering (the “October Offering” or “Offering”) documents and other public statements omitted material facts regarding AbbVie’s interest in acquiring Cerevel at a price well in excess of the $22.81 per share Offering price, artificially deflating Cerevel’s stock price until the merger was announced. Moreover, Cerevel’s controlling shareholder, Bain Capital Investors, LLC (“Bain”), acquired Cerevel shares from the October Offering at an artificially depressed price while allegedly in possession of material nonpublic information regarding AbbVie’s interest.

The merger allowed Bain to receive a windfall of more than $120 million on the shares it acquired at the artificially depressed Offering price.

At the official launch event, program leaders and supporters gathered at the California Mobility Center to unveil the program and spotlight its long-term impact on workforce development, sustainability and educational equity across Sacramento.\n“We’re not just building career pathways – we’re building futures,” said Orville Thomas, CEO of Cal EPIC. “California continues to lead the way in new energy and transportation technologies, and this program will teach students the skills for long-term job opportunities in manufacturing and maintenance of clean tech.”\nCareer and Technical Education (CTE) has proven to be a powerful force for change, especially for the district’s most vulnerable students. According to SCUSD data, students experiencing homelessness (SEH) who complete CTE pathways graduate at a rate of 96%, compared to just 68% of all SEH students. In fact, youth without a high school diploma are 4.5 times more likely to experience homelessness later in life, underscoring the life-changing potential of programs like Green Career Pathways.\n“SCUSD is committed to preparing all students for life after graduation,” said Lisa Allen, Superintendent of Sacramento City Unified School District. “By aligning our district’s educational offerings with industry needs, we’re giving students the tools to break cycles of poverty and step into stable, fulfilling careers in Sacramento’s growing green energy sector.”\nThe Green Career Pathways program directly responds to Sacramento’s increasing demand for skilled workers in the energy, construction, and utilities industries – the fourth-largest employment sector in the region, generating over 1,000 new jobs per year. Students will exit the program with certifications that prepare them for immediate employment, helping them avoid student debt while establishing long-term career stability.\n“Today’s launch of the Green Career Pathways program is a powerful commitment to our students, our environment, and a more equitable clean energy future,” said Congresswoman Doris Matsui (CA-07). “Sacramento is moving forward and investing in local solutions that prepare the next generation for good-paying, climate-resilient careers so all can thrive.”\nIn the Sacramento region, students who complete high school with technical training can earn competitive wages in growing clean energy careers. In-demand roles include:\n“California’s clean energy goals require a workforce that’s as diverse and resilient as the communities we serve,” said Doug Ismail, President of the California Masonic Foundation. “Career and Technical Education doesn’t just teach technical skills – it builds confidence, adaptability, and a mindset of lifelong learning. These are essential traits for navigating a changing economy. This program ensures every student – regardless of background or circumstance – has a clear path to success and the opportunity to help power California’s future.”\nIn addition to hands-on technical training, students will engage in soft skills development, mentorship, and career exploration through partnerships with local employers and experts. Live demonstrations during today’s launch showcased the kind of training students will receive, ranging from EV battery modules to personal protective equipment and solar technologies.\nThe Masons of California have more than 35,000 members and more than 330 lodges located throughout the state. It is guided by the enduring belief that everyone has the ability to make the world a better place. Through Freemasonry, members make true friends, improve themselves, and make a positive impact on our communities. The California Masonic Foundation is committed to making a profound difference in our local communities and touches the lives of thousands of Californians each year.

With the rise in sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary habits, and increasing stress levels, more individuals are finding themselves facing stubborn weight gain and erratic blood glucose levels. These aren't just minor inconveniences—they're risk factors for chronic conditions like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.\nAs awareness grows, so does the demand for natural, holistic alternatives to pharmaceuticals. Consumers are looking beyond prescription medications like metformin and toward plant-based supplements that offer metabolic support without harsh side effects. This is where berberine—a compound derived from various plants—has taken center stage. Often dubbed \"Nature's Ozempic\" on TikTok and wellness forums, berberine is generating a surge in interest as a natural GLP-1 alternative for weight loss and blood sugar support.\n has quickly become a best-seller in the OTC supplement space, thanks to its unique 3-in-1 formula that blends 500 mg of berberine HCL with chromium picolinate and bitter melon extract. Unlike standalone berberine capsules, this supplement is designed to provide comprehensive metabolic enhancement and craving control.\nIts popularity is not just hype. Backed by science and supported by a growing community of satisfied users, NativePath Native Berberine is making a name for itself among weight loss supplements and blood sugar regulators.\nThis in-depth review is designed to guide you through everything you need to know about NativePath Native Berberine:\nWeight loss is often oversimplified into \"eat less, move more,\" but for millions of people, the reality is far more complex. Many individuals are caught in a cycle of yo-yo dieting, unexplained weight gain, and metabolic slowdowns that don't respond to traditional approaches. One major contributor? Insulin resistance. When your body can't use insulin effectively, glucose builds up in your blood instead of being converted into energy. This often leads to stubborn belly fat, fatigue, and an inability to shed pounds—no matter how well you eat or exercise.\nThis is where metabolic health becomes critical. Your metabolism isn't just about how fast you burn calories; it's a complex system that regulates hunger hormones, fat storage, and energy levels. And when that system is out of sync, even the best diet plans fall flat.\nBlood sugar fluctuations often go unnoticed—until they begin to wreak havoc on your daily life. Crashes can leave you feeling dizzy, anxious, or ravenous. Spikes, on the other hand, contribute to long-term health risks such as prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular strain, and chronic inflammation.\nMillions are unknowingly living with blood sugar dysregulation, often mistaking their symptoms for aging, stress, or poor sleep. But the consequences go beyond temporary discomfort. Prolonged blood sugar imbalances can damage blood vessels, nerves, and organs, making early intervention essential.\nPharmaceutical options like metformin are commonly prescribed to address insulin resistance and elevated blood glucose. While they can be effective, they're not without downsides. Many users experience gastrointestinal distress, nutrient depletion (particularly vitamin B12), and dependency without addressing root causes.\nThis leads many to seek out \n—compounds that support insulin function, reduce appetite, and encourage metabolic restoration without the harsh side effects.\nWith an increasing shift toward preventive health and holistic wellness, natural supplements like \n have surged in popularity. Research shows that berberine may activate AMPK—often called the body's \"metabolic master switch\"—which plays a pivotal role in glucose metabolism, fat burning, and energy regulation.\nWhat sets solutions like \n apart is their multi-faceted support for:\nThese benefits address the root causes of metabolic issues—not just the symptoms.\nNativePath Native Berberine is a powerful, plant-based supplement designed to support healthy blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and promote fat metabolism.

{"article_name": "XA Investments Finds Strong Start to 2025 in Fund Launches and Asset Gathering Among Non-Listed Closed End Funds in its First Quarter 2025 Market Update", "published_date": "April 23, 2025 13:25 ET", "source_url": "https://www.globenewswire.com/en/search/organization/XA%2520Investments%2520LLC", "source": ["XA Investments LLC"], "articles_paragraph": "CHICAGO, April  23, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XA Investments LLC (“XAI”), an alternative investment management and consulting firm, announced today that its \n shows a strong start to 2025 in both fund launches and asset gathering. The market update is a comprehensive research report detailing current market trends and industry highlights. The non-listed closed-end fund (CEF) market includes all interval and tender offer funds. The report introduces the \n, analyzes recent developments in co-investment relief, and reviews 2024 net flows across the market.\n“The non-listed CEF market continues to grow after a record year in 2024, with many sponsors launching a second fund and new sponsors entering the market” stated Kimberly Flynn, the president of XAI. “Such robust growth is great for the interval / tender offer fund market. We believe the market's trajectory will remain positive, with significant opportunities for expansion throughout the rest of the year,” she added.\nXAI recently launched their \n, a total return index that tracks the interval fund market, helping to address the lack of easily accessible information on the market. “The XAI Interval Fund Index gives asset managers and financial advisors an unprecedented level of clarity in a market that has been notoriously difficult to track,” Flynn noted. “The first index tracking the interval and tender offer fund market, INTVL serves as the sole barometer for the market, giving investors a snapshot of how interval funds as a whole are performing,” Flynn added.\nThe non-listed CEF market reached a new peak with 270 interval and tender offer funds with a total of $181 billion in net assets and $220 billion in total managed assets, inclusive of leverage, as of March 31, 2025. The market includes 134 interval funds which comprise 50% of the total managed assets at $132.1 billion and 136 tender offer funds which comprise the other 50% with $88.3 billion in total managed assets. This is a significant change from previous quarters, as the number of interval funds has caught up to the total number of tender funds. In Q1 2025, 14 new funds entered the market, representing an increase of four funds compared to the 10 funds launched in Q1 2024. Market-wide net assets increased $9 billion in Q1 2025 from the prior quarter.\nIn total, there are 143 unique fund sponsors in the interval and tender offer fund space, with 50 fund sponsors that have two or more interval and/or tender offer funds currently in the market. Additionally, there are 27 funds currently in the Securities and Exchange Commission registration process from fund sponsors looking to launch another fund. Notably, the top 20 funds decreased their market share from 65% Q4 2024, to 60% in Q1 2025, displaying the growth of new funds in the market. Among the new funds launched in Q1 2025, there were three new interval fund sponsors, HarbourVest, Gemcorp and Pop Venture Advisers.\nIn this quarterly report, XAI covers the 2024-year end net flows which are lagged by reporting cycles. In 2024 funds had positive net flows, totaling over $38 billion, with 67% of funds reporting positive net flows. The majority of net flows in 2024 (53%) went into daily NAV funds without suitability restrictions, while 26% went into funds limited to accredited investors, and 21% went into funds limited to qualified clients. In aggregate, the top 20 largest interval/tender offer funds experienced an increase in net flows year-over-year from 2023 to 2024 including many of the market leaders such as the Cliffwater Corporate Lending Fund, Partners Group Private Equity (Master Fund), LLC, and ACAP Strategic Fund. In addition, Private Credit funds continued to dominate capital raising in 2024, bringing in over $20 billion in net assets, with Venture / Private Equity funds coming in second, bringing in over $11 billion in net assets.\n“The non-listed CEF market continues to grow with a total of 58 funds in the SEC registration process at the end of the first quarter,” said Flynn. “The SEC backlog increased by five funds from the end of 2024 to the end of Q1 2025. So far in 2025, there have been 23 new SEC filings, compared to 15 new filings from Q1 2024, representing a 53% increase in registrations. Newly launched non-listed CEFs spent around seven months in the SEC registration process, with the fund’s asset class continuing to be the main driver of time spent in the SEC review process. Tax-Free Bond funds were the quickest to launch, at 160 days on average spent in registration,” she added.\nAt 49%, the majority of interval and tender offer funds do not have any suitability restrictions for investors imposed at the fund level — 30% of funds are available to accredited investors and 21% are only available to qualified clients. Alternative funds without suitability restrictions also prove to be more accessible and have gathered more assets at $118.2 billion in managed assets or 54% of market-wide assets.\nFor more information on the interval fund market and to read our full quarterly report on non-listed CEFs, please visit the CEF Market research page linked \n and click ‘Subscribe’ for access to XA Investments’ online research portal and pricing information. In addition, please contact \n or 888-903-3358 with questions.\nXA Investments LLC (“XAI”) is a Chicago-based firm founded by XMS Capital Partners in 2016. XAI serves as the investment adviser for two listed closed-end funds and an interval closed-end fund, respectively the XAI Octagon Floating Rate & Alternative Income Trust, the XAI Madison Equity Premium Income Fund, and the Octagon XAI CLO Income Fund. In addition to investment advisory services, the firm also provides investment fund structuring and consulting services focused on registered closed-end funds to meet institutional client needs.

On February 13, 2025, Perpetua published an updated cash flow model for the Stibnite Gold Project, unveiling additional capital expenses of $952 million, a more than 75% increase from the original figures presented to investors and well beyond the suggested 10-20% increase contemplated by defendants. The Company attributed these increased costs on inflation, indirect costs, higher mining costs, and direct decisions defendants made with respect to the project, including the choice to change the design of the electrical poles from timber to steel and the decision to “buy-and-build instead of lease the oxygen plant.” Following this news, the price of Perpetua’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $11.97 per share on February 13, 2025, Perpetua’s stock price fell to $9.29 per share on February 14, 2025, a decline of about 22.39% in the span of just a single day.\n Shareholders should not delay in registering for this class action.

Nearly 1 million Americans are living with PD, with estimates suggesting the number will reach 1.2 million by 2030, according to the \n. \nT.J. Geist, principal advocate at Allsup, explained that the growing number of people receiving Parkinson’s diagnoses highlights the critical role of Social Security disability benefits and financial choices for individuals and families. “​Parkinson’s disease can begin affecting people in their 40s and 50s, which means it’s important to understand the resources and options available, including applying for SSDI benefits if they can no longer work due to the disease,” Geist said.\nPD is the second-most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease, affecting over \n people worldwide. Symptoms such as tremors, movement difficulties, and stiffness often lead to severe disability and the need for long-term care.​ \nThe annual economic impact of Parkinson's disease on patients, families, and the U.S. government is estimated at $51.9 billion, according to research from \n. This figure includes both direct medical costs, such as hospitalizations and medications, and non-medical costs, such as lost wages and caregiver time. These figures highlight the substantial financial burden the disease places on individuals and the broader economy. \nAllsup provides essential support to individuals living with Parkinson’s disease by guiding them through the SSDI application process, helping them receive the benefits they need as efficiently as possible. “More than 161 million U.S. workers are covered by SSDI benefits, which are a vital resource for those navigating the path to medical stability when a condition like Parkinson’s is diagnosed,” Geist added. \nInnovations in PD research offer new paths for understanding. Scientists at \n have discovered that the protein alpha-synuclein plays a significant role in the progression of PD, opening potential avenues for slowing or halting the disease’s advancement. In addition, The Michael J. Fox Foundation’s development of a spinal fluid test that accurately detects Parkinson’s before symptom onset marks a significant leap forward in early intervention and personalized medicine. This \n, which examines spinal fluid for PD’s pathology with 93% accuracy, is a major step forward in understanding and treating PD more effectively, promising to revolutionize both research and patient care.​\n“​These medical advancements are critical as they can provide the documentation needed for SSDI benefits approval,” Geist explained. “​Our professionals have seen remarkable progress in medical treatments for Parkinson’s over the years, and these developments are important for individuals as they make decisions about their healthcare, work, and long-term financial planning.”​\nAs groundbreaking studies in Parkinson’s research continue to unfold, they signal a new era of treatment and understanding. The significance of a supportive network remains vital, particularly for those diagnosed under age 50. Organizations like the Young Onset Parkinson’s Network (\n) play an important role in connecting individuals with young onset Parkinson’s disease (YOPD) to critical resources and support, fostering a sense of community and hope as they face the challenges of the disease.\nFor more information about applying for SSDI benefits, filing your appeal if you were denied, or to see if you are eligible, visit \n or call\n. \nBe sure to ask about our Disability Financial Solutions for SSDI customers.

The grind never stops, and for many people, the morning starts with a groggy brain, low motivation, and a sluggish body. Reaching for another cup of coffee seems like the only option—but what if that's only masking the problem instead of fixing it?\nThis is where many people find themselves stuck: trying to fight daily fatigue, brain fog, bloating, and mood swings with quick fixes that never quite deliver. Whether it's gut discomfort, lack of energy, or simply feeling \"off,\" the real solution lies deeper—in nutrition, gut health, and adaptogenic support.\nIf there's one person you can trust to \"roundhouse\" those issues into shape, it's Chuck Norris. More than just an action star, he's a symbol of vitality, strength, and no-nonsense health. That's why the \n was developed: to create a reliable, daily wellness solution powered by real ingredients, science-backed nutrients, and the legacy of someone who's always been known for punching problems in the face—literally and figuratively.\nMorning Kick is a \n that's already earning buzz for being one of the most complete, easy-to-use, and effective daily drink mixes available. Whether you're dealing with digestion issues, low energy, mood swings, or aging concerns, this blend promises to deliver real support without the jitters, crashes, or artificial junk.\nIn this article, we'll go far beyond the label. You'll discover:\nThis is your full investigative look at \n, designed to help you feel confident, informed, and energized before you make a decision.\nIf you're struggling with fatigue, brain fog, bloating, and mood swings, you're far from alone. Millions of people experience these symptoms every day and often chalk them up to stress, poor sleep, or just getting older. But the truth is, these issues usually share a common root cause—and it's not a caffeine deficiency.\nThe modern lifestyle has created a perfect storm of imbalances in the body. We eat on the go, rely on processed foods, scroll late into the night, and live in a state of chronic low-grade stress. Over time, these habits chip away at our foundational systems—our gut, adrenal glands, and immune defenses.\nThese red flags show up as:\nWhat's worse, these symptoms are often treated in isolation, when, in fact, they stem from deeper biological disruptions—particularly poor gut health, hormone imbalance, and nutrient depletion.\nThe gut isn't just for digestion. It plays a critical role in how your brain functions, how your body absorbs energy, and how you respond to stress; when your gut is off—whether from antibiotics, poor diet, or chronic inflammation—everything else can fall out of balance.\nThe \n is a well-studied pathway that shows how microbiome health impacts mood, mental clarity, and energy metabolism. If your microbiome is imbalanced, you're likely not absorbing nutrients properly or producing enough neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, or GABA—all of which are key for mental clarity, motivation, and emotional stability.\nWhen you're constantly stressed, your body produces excess cortisol. Over time, this can blunt your energy, increase inflammation, and disrupt your sleep. Your adrenal glands, responsible for managing stress, begin to burn out. The result? You feel tired, wired, or both—all the time.\nThis stress loop drains your system, leaving you vulnerable to infection, fatigue, and burnout. It's a vicious cycle—one that can't be fixed with another shot of espresso or a few hours of extra sleep.\nEven if you eat \"pretty well,\" chances are you're not getting enough of the critical nutrients your body needs to feel truly energized. That's because modern agricultural practices and food processing strip away essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\nKey compounds like chlorophyll, prebiotic fiber, plant-based adaptogens, and bioavailable vitamins are often missing from the standard American diet. Without them, your cells can't produce enough ATP (energy), your immune system weakens, and inflammation rises.\nThis is where the \n becomes more than just another supplement. It's designed to help fill these foundational gaps by supporting:\nIt doesn't overload your body with stimulants or synthetic additives—it nourishes it from the inside out, helping you feel stronger, more alert, and more in control.\nIf you've been jumping from one product to another without long-term relief, the issue may not be your willpower or motivation—it might be that you're trying to fix the symptoms instead of the root.\nWhen most people think of Chuck Norris, they imagine strength, discipline, and an unwavering commitment to excellence. From his time as a world martial arts champion to his iconic Hollywood roles, Chuck Norris has always embodied resilience and self-mastery. But behind the action-hero persona is a man who has dedicated himself to lifelong health, clean living, and helping others achieve peak performance.\nSo when \n, it isn’t just marketing. It’s a signal that the product has to live up to his standards. The \n isn’t a gimmick—it’s the result of years of personal experience, research-backed formulation, and a mission to help everyday people feel better and live stronger.\nChuck Norris and his team launched Roundhouse Provisions with one clear goal: to make \n that support real people through the demands of real life. No empty promises, no miracle cures—just powerful, straightforward nutrition.\nThe company is built on transparency and quality. Every ingredient in the \n is there for a reason. Each jar is manufactured in the USA in \n, ensuring that quality control and safety are top priorities.\nRoundhouse Provisions isn’t interested in short-term hype. They want long-term health solutions that their customers can count on, and that’s what Morning Kick aims to deliver.\nChuck Norris knows that time is precious and life doesn’t stop moving. That’s why Morning Kick is designed to be simple, quick, and easy to use—no pills to swallow, no complicated regimes to follow.\nInstead, this \n can be mixed in seconds, tastes great (thanks to its natural strawberry lemonade flavor), and supports full-body wellness with just one daily scoop.\nAnd when Chuck Norris says it works, people pay attention—not because it’s a punchline, but because his reputation for delivering results is built into everything he does.\nThere’s a reason people trust the \n over many generic green blends on the market.

Now, let's see how it stacks up against other popular green powders in the market. In today's oversaturated wellness market, there are dozens of \n claiming to support energy, digestion, and overall health. Some of the most recognized include \n, \n, and \n. But how does \n measure up?\nLet's delve into how Morning Kick stands out—ingredient by ingredient, benefit by benefit. This will give you a comprehensive understanding of what sets Morning Kick apart in the greens powders market.\nMany competing superfood powders use \n, which means the exact amounts of each ingredient are hidden. This can make it difficult for consumers to know if they're truly getting effective doses of the good stuff.\nMorning Kick doesn't play that game. It provides a clear label with transparent dosages, making it easy to understand exactly what you're consuming. By contrast, AG1 includes over 75 ingredients, but most of them are listed within hidden blends. Organifi and Bloom also use blends that may underdeliver key ingredients, especially adaptogens.\nIf you value transparency, Morning Kick is the smarter choice.\nOne of the most noticeable differences is that \n, which are essential for maintaining healthy joints, improving skin elasticity, and supporting muscle recovery. This is a huge bonus, especially for people who are active or want to support healthy aging.\nAthletic Greens, Bloom, and Organifi do not include any collagen in their formulations. Morning Kick delivers added value by supporting areas of wellness that other green powders overlook entirely.\nMost people purchase green powders for digestive health, yet many competitors only partially address this issue. Morning Kick contains both \n, a shelf-stable probiotic known for surviving stomach acid, and \n, a powerful prebiotic fiber that feeds healthy gut bacteria.\nSome competitors include probiotics, but not all strains are as stable or effective as Bacillus coagulans. Others skip prebiotics altogether. Morning Kick's dual gut-health approach makes it a much stronger option for supporting the \n, nutrient absorption, and regularity.\nStress support is often missing in wellness formulas, despite how essential it is for modern health. Morning Kick includes a clinical dose of \n, an adaptogen that's been shown to reduce cortisol, improve mood, and enhance focus.\nOrganifi includes ashwagandha but at a lower dose. Athletic Greens and Bloom Greens typically don't include any adaptogenic herbs at all. For those battling fatigue, burnout, or anxiety, Morning Kick stands out as a \n that doesn't require additional supplementation.\nMorning Kick is known for its clean, refreshing \n, which makes it easy to look forward to every morning. Unlike many green powders that taste grassy or chalky, Morning Kick mixes smoothly and has a naturally pleasant taste profile.\nOrganifi's minty green flavor can be polarizing. AG1 has an earthy taste that may not be appealing to new users. Bloom offers fruity flavors, but some users report gritty texture issues. Morning Kick excels in flavor, which is essential for long-term compliance and daily use.\nWhen comparing value, Morning Kick is priced at $49.95 for 30 servings, which breaks down to approximately $1.67 per scoop. This is significantly more affordable than AG1, which costs around $99 per jar, or about $3.30 per serving.

{"article_name": "AB Science announces that EMA granted orphan drug status to AB8939 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia", "published_date": "April 23, 2025 12:59 ET", "source_url": "https://www.globenewswire.com/en/search/organization/AB%2520Science", "source": ["AB Science"], "articles_paragraph": " (Euronext - FR0010557264 - AB) announces today that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) granted orphan drug status to AB8939 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\nAB8939 had already obtained orphan drug designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in AML.\nGranting of this orphan drug status in the EU is a significant milestone because it means that the COMP considered that AB8939 offers a significant benefit to people suffering from this condition in addition to existing treatments.\nIndeed, the criteria to obtain orphan drug designation at EMA differ from those at FDA and are very stringent for the following reasons :\nIn support of the significant benefit of AB8939 in AML, AB Science has released preclinical data from mouse models demonstrating a significant benefit of AB8939 treatment over current therapies, such as cytarabine, azacitidine (Vidaza®) and venetoclax (Venclexta®). This included:\nAB Science also presented preliminary efficacy and safety data from phase 1 of AB8939 as a monotherapy, with a 3-day treatment cycle (stage 1 of phase 1) and a 14-day treatment cycle (stage 2 of phase 1).\nProfessor Olivier Hermine, President of AB Science's Scientific Committee, member of the French Academy of Sciences and Head of the Hematology Department at Necker Hospital, commented\nAB8939 is a new synthetic molecule which jointly targets cancer cells, by destabilizing the microtubules essential for cell division, and cancer stem cells, by inhibiting enzymes (ALDH1A1 and ALDH2) essential for maintaining their physiological state and survival. The molecule ‘1-{4-[2-(5-ethoxymethyl-2-methylphenylamino)-oxazol-5-yl]phenyl}imidazolidin-2-one’ is the chemical name of AB8939. The intellectual property of AB8939 is 100% owned by AB Science.\nEuropean orphan drug designation is granted by the European Commission to medicinal products intended for the treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect no more than 5 in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU), or for which it must be unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product will generate sufficient revenue to justify the investment required for its development. In addition, there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned, or, if such a method exists, the drug must offer a significant benefit to sufferers.\nAn orphan drug designation in the EU confers a range of benefits on sponsoring companies, including scientific advice on all aspects of product development at a reduced fee, direct access to the centralized marketing authorization procedure, and eligibility for certain financial incentives made available by the Community and Member States to support research and development of orphan drugs. If the product is approved for marketing, the designation also confers 10 years of marketing exclusivity from product registration if the orphan drug designation still prevails at the time of marketing authorization.\nIn February 2018, the EMA published a Q&A document to clear up common misunderstandings about the meaning of orphan drug designation and other aspects related to orphan drugs: \nFounded in 2001, AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research, development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs), a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells. Our programs target only diseases with high unmet medical needs, often lethal with short term survival or rare or refractory to previous line of treatment. \nAB Science has developed a proprietary portfolio of molecules and the Company’s lead compound, masitinib, has already been registered for veterinary medicine and is developed in human medicine in oncology, neurological diseases, inflammatory diseases and viral diseases. The company is headquartered in Paris, France, and listed on Euronext Paris (ticker: AB).\nFurther information is available on AB Science’s website: \n.\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements. These statements are not historical facts. These statements include projections and estimates as well as the assumptions on which they are based, statements based on projects, objectives, intentions and expectations regarding financial results, events, operations, future services, product development and their potential or future performance.\nThese forward-looking statements can often be identified by the words \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"intend\", \"estimate\" or \"plan\" as well as other similar terms. While AB Science believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of AB Science and which may imply that results and actual events significantly differ from those expressed, induced or anticipated in the forward-looking information and statements.

(“TBBK” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: TBBK) and reminds investors of the \n to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See \n.\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) that Bancorp had underrepresented the significant risk of default or loss on its REBL loan portfolio; (2) that the Company’s current expected credit loss methodology was insufficient to account for the provision and/or allowance of credit losses; (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company was reasonably likely to increase its provision for credit losses; (4) that there were material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting; (5) that its financial statements had not been approved by its independent auditor; (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company’s financial statements could not be relied upon; and (7) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\nOn March 21, 2024, at approximately 9:45 a.m. EST, Culper Research issued a report, alleging that the Company had underrepresented significant risks of default and/or loss on certain real estate bridge loans (“REBLs”). The report alleged the Company’s loan book is “rife with unsophisticated syndicated borrowers” who were “coaxed by promises of generational wealth through passive income” with “get rich quick” promises. The report alleged that the Company’s REBL loan portfolio is filled with apartments which are “quite literally, crumbling,” with high vacancies and multiple condemnations. The report stated the Company “blindly reassures investors that its book contains ‘no substantial risk of default or loss,’” but, in reality, the Company’s “REBL portfolio faces meaningful risks and will result in meaningful losses.” The report concluded that the Company’s reserve of only “$4.7 million in REBL loan allowances, representing a mere 0.24% of the total REBL book” is “short by an order of magnitude or more.”\nOn this news, the Company’s share price fell $3.63, or 10.15%, to close at $32.12 per share on March 21, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.\nThen, on October 24, 2024, after the market closed, the Company announced its third quarter 2024 financial results in a press release for the period ended September 30, 2024, reporting $51.5 million in net income. The Company attributed the results in part, to “a new CECL [current expected credit losses methodology] factor” to the Company’s analysis of REBL loans classified as either special mention or substandard “which increased the provision for credit losses and resulted in an after-tax reduction in net income of $1.5 million.” The Company further explained its results also reflected “prior period interest income reversals on real estate bridge loans transferred to nonaccrual or modified” which “resulted in an after-tax reduction in net income of $1.2 million.”\nOn this news, the Company’s share price fell $7.95, or 14.47%, to close at $47.01 per share on October 25, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.\nFinally, on March 4, 2025, after the market closed, Bancorp disclosed that its “financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 through 2024 as shown in the Annual Report should no longer be relied upon.” The Company explained that its auditors for those years “did not provide approval to include [the] audit opinion . . . or [the] consent to the incorporation by reference of their audit report in certain registration statements.” The Company further revealed it is “working expeditiously to perform and complete additional closing procedures related to accounting for consumer fintech loans in the allowance for credit losses” in order to file an amended annual report. The Company also revealed it “is evaluating the impact of this non-reliance on its conclusions regarding disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.” As a result of the foregoing, the Company stated it would be unable to file timely its fiscal year 2024 annual report.\nOn this news, the Company’s share price fell $2.34, or 4.38%, to close at $51.25 per share on March 5, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

ASCO plans to release further details for regular abstracts on May 22, 2025 at 5:00 PM EDT.\nPerspective designed [\nPb]VMT-α-NET to target and deliver \nPb to tumor sites expressing SSTR2. The Company is conducting a multi-center, open-label dose escalation, dose expansion study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier \n) of [\nPb]VMT-α-NET in patients with unresectable or metastatic SSTR2-positive neuroendocrine tumors who have not received prior radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPT). Results with a data cut-off date of January 10, 2025 from the first nine patients enrolled into Cohorts 1 and 2 of the study were most recently presented as a poster at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (\n) in January 2025. Cohort 2 was reopened in August 2024. By 3Q and 4Q 2025, patients enrolled after the cohort reopened and through February 28, 2025, will have had the opportunity for at least 32 weeks of follow-up after their initial doses, sufficient time to receive at least one scan after their full treatment (up to four doses every eight weeks), if they receive all four doses of treatment per protocol.\nPerspective designed [\nPb]VMT01 to target and deliver \nPb to tumor sites expressing MC1R, a protein that can be overexpressed in metastatic melanoma tumors.\n The Company is conducting a multi-center, open-label dose finding, dose expansion study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier \n) in patients with histologically confirmed melanoma and MC1R-positive imaging scans.

The Company is also developing complementary imaging diagnostics that incorporate the same targeting moieties, which provides the opportunity to personalize treatment and optimize patient outcomes. This \"theranostic\" approach enables the ability to see the specific tumor and then treat it to potentially improve efficacy and minimize toxicity.\nThe Company's melanoma (VMT01) and neuroendocrine tumor (VMT-α-NET) programs are in Phase 1/2a imaging and therapy trials in the U.S. for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and neuroendocrine tumors, respectively.

When key stakeholders are unaware of potential threats, fraud reporting on applications becomes fragmented—leaving businesses vulnerable and divided.\nTo prevent bad actors from slipping through cracks due to miscommunication, inconsistent verification processes, and limited visibility across teams, Bectran has introduced intelligent workflows that seal the gaps in fraud reporting. By surfacing risks as they are flagged, Bectran equips all teams with shared transparency and a fully traceable audit log—while tracking and identifying suspicious applications in real time.\nThis capability is powered by Bectran’s AI-driven fraud suite and automated prevention network, which continuously scans and warns of discrepancies and risk signals across applications, applicants, and accounts. Paired with Bectran’s fraud suite, it brings a deeper layer of analysis to reviews—helping credit teams quickly catch and correct false positives caused by human error or incomplete data, without compromising on fraud detection accuracy.\nAlongside enhancements to the verification workflow, Bectran has improved existing reports by including summaries of detected fraudulent activity. These additions provide greater visibility into potential risk, allowing credit managers to quickly assess application status, view comprehensive audit trails and follow the progression of investigations into fraudulent activity.\nTogether, these tools enable credit managers to take quicker and more confident action in their reviews—securing cash flow and keeping departments informed of all suspected fraudulent activity.\n“We recognize that it is human ingenuity and analysis working in tandem with automated systems and real-time data that outperforms any other method of fraud prevention. When skilled credit managers are given the tools and the authority to make determinations regarding credit risk, the results are indisputable,” says Ali Kidwai, Bectran’s Director of Product, Implementation & Engineering—Enterprise Portfolio Management.\n \n is the premier SaaS platform for Finance Departments, akin to CRM for Sales. Trusted by diverse organizations, from SMEs to Fortune 100 companies, we streamline credit processing by over 98%, reducing credit defaults and collection costs.

The pipe coating market has emerged as vital sector, providing advanced protective solutions to enhance pipeline performance and lifespan. As industrial activities and urban infrastructure expand worldwide, the relevance of durable pipe coatings continue to intensify.\nPipe coatings play a critical role in protecting pipelines from corrosion, physical damage, and chemical exposure, ensuring the longevity and efficiency of oil, gas, water, and wastewater infrastructure. As global energy demands surge and water management becomes more crucial, the pipeline coating industry is experiencing substantial growth. These coatings not only serve as protective barriers but also improve the flow efficiency of transported materials by minimizing friction. The market has expanded beyond convectional anti-corrosion solutions to include advanced coating technologies such as fusion-bonded epoxy, thermoplastic polymer coatings, and liquid-applied systems.\nThese innovations have emerged due to rising concerns about pipeline integrity and environmental safety, especially in regions experiencing extreme climate conditions or undergoing aggressive industrial development. Increasing investments in pipeline infrastructure projects, especially across North America, the Middle East, and Asia-pacific, are also acting as significant growth enablers. Moreover, stricter regulations regarding pipeline maintenance and leakage prevention are encouraging stakeholders to opt for high-performance and sustainable coating solutions.\nThey are selected based on the coating material, pipeline design, internal coating and external coating forces, connectivity, the development of processes and durability, impermeability, and the frequency of maintenance.\nIt is helpful for wastewater and transportation, which are made mainly of water with a slight amount of solid waste. Depending on the pressure in the pipes and other factors, it can be made of concrete pipes, PVC, cast iron, or clay. Pipe diameters determined by the materials used and the pressure inside the tube.\nIt is made of steel that is treated with the outer coating of the Catholic and protection to prevent external corrosion. Welding oil pipeline connection uses. The oil pipeline is divided into two types: crude oil pipeline, which transported crude oil to refineries, and pipeline product, which transported goods such as gasoline to the market.\nThe liquid epoxy \n is very easy. The chemical reaction between the epoxy resin and hardener or catalyst liquid epoxy produces. A chemical reaction transforms the two into the hard layer when you’re sided by side. You can apply epoxy with a brush, roller, or spray after mixing. \nThe use of liquid epoxy usually in this area welds size cover, fittings, valves, as well as for the rehabilitation field of short parts of the tubes. He also works as an additional layer of protection at the front of the soil into the air, where underground plumbing meets the atmosphere.\nCoal tar epoxy (CTE) is a liquid epoxy that has had some of the mineral fillers replaced with semi-liquid coal tar pitch. CTE cures by combining resin and hardener (parts A and B) to generate a thermoset covering, which is typical of all chemically epoxy resins. The thickness of coal tar epoxy coatings, like liquid epoxy coatings, determines by the particle content and the number of applications applies to the steel.\nCTE applications for pipeline work are typically between 15 and 35 mils thick. The cure period of coal tar epoxy is relatively long. It will take five to seven days to properly cure at ambient temperatures (for example, 75 F). Force curing at 150 ° F might cut cure time to 8 hours.\nA primer (FBE or liquid epoxy), an adhesive intermediate layer (copolymer), and a topcoat make up a three-layer coating (polyolefin). This type of coating has normally uses in pipelines with high electrical resistance since the 1980s. The first coat for three-layer coatings, like FBE coatings, involves preheating the pipes. \nThe FBE and copolymer layers spray on, following by a final topcoat (the tie layer can alternatively apply through side extrusion). Polyethene frequently uses as a topcoat, while polypropylene is preferable if the pipeline can expose to high service temperatures.\nOne of the most common types of steel pipe coating is galvanizing or galvanizing several. Even if the metal itself has several great corrosion resistance and tensile strength capabilities, it still requires a zinc coating for a better finish. Galvanizing can complete in a variety of ways, depending on the method’s availability. \nThe most often used method, however, is hot-dip or batch dip galvanizing, which involves immersing a steel pipe in molten zinc. A metallurgical reaction between the steel pipe alloy and the zinc produces a surface finish on the metal that delivers a corrosion-resistant quality never seen previously on the pipe. \nAnother benefit of galvanizing is the cost savings.  Numerous firms and businesses have chosen this method. Because it is easy and does not require any secondary operations or post-processing.\nThe pipe coatings market is gaining traction, driven by its multifunctional, high-performance systems. Recently there has been noticed an upsurge in the demand of pipes or pipelines for sustainable and smart coatings. A shift towards investment and R&D focusing on increasing the durability, adaptability, and environmental compatibility of coatings. Technological improvements, environmental regulations, and expanding infrastructure across the globe are propelling demand for better, longer-lasting, and greener coatings. From traditional epoxy layers to intelligent self-healing coatings, the market is transforming how pipelines are protected, ensuring reliability and efficiency across industrial landscape. As emerging economies seek to modernize their pipeline systems, the global pipe coatings industry stands at the forefront of this transformation.\nAdditionally, the pipeline coating market is undergoing transformative development driven by innovation, infrastructure expansion and increasing regulatory focus on pipeline safety. In recent years, several noteworthy advancements have been noticed over the year. Major players are forming strategic alliances to expand their geographical footprint and improve product offerings. This includes partnerships between raw materials suppliers, coating manufacturers, and pipeline installation firms. Beyond pipeline installations, there is an increasing demand for coating solutions tailored for refurbishment and retrofitting of aging infrastructure, particularly in North America and Europe.\nThe introduction of robotic and automated systems for coating pipe, especially in inaccessible hazardous areas, has improved consistency, efficiency, and safety. New digital tools are being integrated to monitor coatings thickness, drying times, and environmental conditions in real-time during application, ensuring long-lasting performance.\nNorth America continues to dominate the global pipe coatings market, underpinned by its developed oil and gas industry, advanced pipeline infrastructure, and heightened environmental regulations. The United States, Canada, and Mexico are at the forefront of this regional leadership, driven by extensive pipeline network with vast miles of underground pipelines, particularly in the U.S. and Canada, the region requires robust, high-performance coatings to combat corrosion, abrasion, and environmental stress.\nAmerican companies lead the way in developing advanced coating materials such as fusion bonded epoxy and multi- layer polyolefin coatings, ensuring superior durability and operational efficiency. Ongoing repair and modernization of aging pipeline infrastructure further fuel the demand for protective coatings, particularly in the oil and water transport sectors.\nThis regional durability is shaping a competitive and highly dynamic global market for pipe coatings, offering diverse opportunities for key players to innovate, collaborate and expand.\nAsia-pacific is witnessing the fastest growth in the pipe coatings market, fueled by rapid industrialization, urban development, and large-scale energy projects.

The automotive refinish coating market is experiencing significant growth, primarily fueled by the rising trend of vehicle customization, continual advancements in coating not only enhance the aesthetics appeal of vehicles but also provide essential protection against environmental wear and damage.\nThe automotive refinish coating market is accelerating steadily, propelled by the increasing demand for vehicle restoration, customization, and protection. As more consumers invest in personal vehicles and seek to maintain their aesthetic appeal, the need for high-performance coatings continues to rise. In parallel, advancements in eco-friendly formulations and rising environmental awareness are reshaping the market landscape.\nFrom collision repairs to creative restyling, refinish coatings are becoming essential in both utility and design. Moreover, the market is being shaped by evolving environment regulations, technological innovations, and a growing emphasis on sustainability. The expansion of body shops and repair centers worldwide further contributes to the markets strong outlook.\nAn important factor for automotive refinish that never changes is customer satisfaction. One way to ensure satisfaction is with a high quality, fully optimized coating product, and manufacturing a high-quality coating starts with the formulation.  Most automotive coating systems consist of three parts: primer, base coat, and top coat.\nMany of the lightweight plastics used in automobiles today are notoriously difficult to adhere to. Primers are used to prepare a surface for a coating to ensure adequate adhesion. These formulations typically consist of a binder resin, a solvent, and additives to improve wetting & surface area. The binder resin in a primer system must be able to bond to low energy surfaces and improve surface energy for subsequent coatings.\nWhen most people think of automotive paint they are thinking of a basecoat. The basecoat is what provides the color to an automotive coating system.  A basecoat formulation consists of a binder resin, pigments or pigment dispersion, solvent, and additives to improve wetting & leveling. Ensuring maximum pigment wetting and proper pigment orientation is critical to manufacturing a high-quality basecoat.\nOnce the basecoat is applied that beautiful paint job needs to be protected; this is where the topcoat comes into play.  Topcoats or lacquers are applied over a basecoat and are typically hard, glossy coatings that are resistant to moisture, chemicals, UV, abrasion, and temperature. A typical topcoat formulation consists again of a binder resin, solvent, and wetting / leveling aids.  It is incredibly important that the binder resin for a topcoat provide optimal durability to ensure a long lasting automotive refinish coating system.\nAsia-pacific dominated the market in 2024, due to its robust automotive industry, expanding vehicle fleet, and growing middle class population. Countries such as China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand are the top contributors in the region. These nations exhibit high vehicle ownership, increasing accident rates and growing consumer appetite for aesthetic enhancements and customization. Moreover, the presence of major automotive manufacturers and a surge in body shop establishments contribute to sustained demand for high-performance refinish coatings. The region is also witnessing a rise in eco-conscious practices, with stricter regulations driving the shift towards low-VOC and waterborne coatings.\nNorth America is emerging as the fastest-growing region in the automotive refinish coatings market. The United States and Canada are at the forefront, with a sharp increase in vehicle repair and maintenance activities. Key drivers include the growing number of on-road vehicles, heightened consumer interest in vehicle restoration, and rapid technological adoption in refinishing process. Additionally, stringent environmental norms and governmental incentives are encouraging manufacturing sustainable and high-efficiency coatings. A well -established automotive aftermarket and rising investments in research and development further amplify the region’s potential growth.\nThe polyurethane segment dominated the market in 2024, the market is experiencing growth due to its high resistance to abrasion, corrosion, and harsh environmental conditions, polyurethane-based coatings provide a superior glossy finish and robust protection, making them ideal for premium automotive refinishing. Their compatibility with both metallic and plastic surfaces further strengthens their dominance.\nHowever, the acrylic segment is attributed to grow in the market in its forecasting period, due to growing demand for lightweight, cost-efficient coatings that offer ease of application and faster drying times. With advancements in water-based formulations, acrylics are becoming increasingly viable for eco-friendly automotive refinishing solutions, particularly in regions with strict environmental regulations.\nSolvent borne segment dominated the market in 2024, the market is experiencing growth due to their exceptional adhesion, color consistency, and ability to perform well in diverse climatic conditions. They are especially preferred in regions with humid or unpredictable weather, where water-borne alternatives may face challenges in application. However, environmental concerns and stringent government regulations regarding VOC emissions are gradually shifting the spotlight.\nMeanwhile, Water borne coatings segment is attributed to grow in the market in its forecasting period, due to their reduced environmental impact and safer usage. These coatings are low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and are being increasingly adopted by body shops and manufacturers aiming to comply with green policies while maintaining high-quality standards.\nThe basecoats segment dominated the market in 2024, the market is experiencing growth due to defining the visual identity of a vehicle, contributing to its aesthetic appeal through rich color, depth, and texture. As consumer preference shifts towards customization and unique styling, basecoats continue to see strong demand.\nHowever, the topcoats segment is attributed to grow in the market in its forecasting period, due to rising expectations for protective finishes. These coatings enhance durability, provide UV resistance, and shield the underlying paint from environmental damage. As awareness about vehicle care grows, more consumers are opting for high-performance topcoats to prolong the lifespan and appearance of their vehicles.\n5> years age of vehicles dominated the market in 2024, the market is experiencing growth due to newer vehicles are more inclined to invest in maintenance and cosmetic upgrades to preserve resale value and aesthetic appeal. Consumers are looking for ways to extend the lifespan and appearance of their vehicles without investing in full-scale replacements, which bodes well for this segment’s future growth.\nOn the other hand, the 5-10 years bracket is attributed to grow in the market in its forecasting period, as Vehicles in this range are more prone to surface damage due to prolonged use and minor accidents. As the average vehicle ownership period increases worldwide, this age group is expected to fuel demand for cost-effective, restorative coating solutions.\nTowards Chem and Materials is a leading global consulting firm specializing in providing comprehensive and strategic research solutions across the chemical and materials industries.

{"article_name": "NewtekOne, Inc. Closes ALP Loan Securitization with Sale of $184 Million of Rated Notes", "published_date": "April 23, 2025 12:10 ET", "source_url": "https://www.globenewswire.com/en/search/organization/NewtekOneδ%2520Inc§", "source": ["NewtekOne, Inc."], "articles_paragraph": "BOCA RATON, Fla., April  23, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \n (the “Company”) (NASDAQ: NEWT) announced today that it has closed a $184 million securitization backed by $216 million of Alternative Loan Program (“ALP”) loans. This securitization, NALP Business Loan Trust 2025-1, represents the Company’s third asset-backed securitization secured by ALP loans, the first two of which were executed out of NewtekOne joint ventures, and is the Company’s 16th rated securitization. All of the Company’s prior securitizations have maintained their initial investment-grade ratings or been upgraded.\nPursuant to the securitization, the Company sold $155,930,000 of Class A Notes, $23,820,000 of Class B Notes, and $4,330,000 of a Class C Note (collectively, the “Notes”) issued by NALP Business Loan Trust 2025-1. The Notes are backed by $216,564,700 of collateral, consisting of $184,414,700 of Company originated ALP loans and a $32,150,000 prefunding account to acquire additional ALP loans originated by the Company. The securitization was two times oversubscribed.\nThe Company underwrites ALP loans with the thesis that the underlying businesses are the primary sources of principal and interest payments of the loans. The Company requires that almost all 20% or greater equity owners of the businesses personally guarantee loans. In addition, all business assets of the borrower, including owner-occupied commercial real estate, accounts receivable and inventory, and machinery and equipment, are pledged as collateral against ALP loans. In many cases, the Company also takes liens on personal assets of the business owners.\nBarry Sloane, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are extremely pleased to have completed a third securitization backed by ALP loans and appreciate the effort from our underwriters, Deutsche Bank, Capital One Securities, and Santander. We intend to continue to issue these securitizations backed by ALP loans and continue to view ALP loans as an important element to the Company’s financial performance. Origination of ALP loans allows us to leverage our existing deal flow, software, personnel, operational infrastructure, and securitization expertise. ALP loans add to the existing menu of loan options available to our independent business owner clients; that menu includes SBA 7(a) loans, SBA 504 loans, conventional commercial real estate loans, and conventional commercial and industrial term and revolving loans. With the ALP loan option, we maximize our vast referral system, which generates 600-900 daily referrals, and, more importantly, flexibility for our borrower clients. ALP loans support borrowing needs up to $15 million, versus government programs that come with size limits and conventional bank loans that have loans-to-one-borrower limitations. Because ALP loans fully amortize over 10-25 years without balloon payments, borrowers benefit from lower monthly payments compared to other options in the market, such as merchant cash advances. ALP borrowers also appreciate that ALP loans do not have typical covenants of conventional bank loans, which provides borrowers with the added flexibility to manage leverage levels, set dividend policies, and execute acquisitions without having to get approval from a lender. To access the benefits of ALP loans, borrowers are willing to pay higher interest rates and to offer personal guarantees, including, in many instances, liens on personal assets, which provide collateral enhancement to the credit.”\nMr. Sloane continued, “The gross weighted-average coupon of the collateral pool is expected to be approximately 13.30% following the end of the prefunding period. The Company receives a servicing fee of 100 basis points on the loans, which means NALP Business Loan Trust 2025-1 nets a weighted-average coupon of approximately 12.30% on its assets. With a weighted average coupon to investors in the Notes of 6.62%, there is roughly 570 basis points of margin to support the bond holders’ yield. We are very pleased with the execution of this third ALP securitization with 10 institutions purchasing the Notes, which, we believe, demonstrates that we have built and continue to build a loyal investor base of ALP-backed securitization notes that we began issuing in 2021. That investor base includes some of the largest money managers, insurance companies, and financial institutions in the world. Since 2019, when we launched the ALP, we have originated roughly $480 million of ALP loans and currently have approximately $400 million outstanding and anticipate being able to grow ALP loans at a healthy pace given that an average ALP approximates $4 million compared to an average of $450,000 for an SBA 7(a) loan. NewtekOne originated 2,400 loan units in 2024 and projects it will originate 2,700 units in 2025. From a credit quality perspective, we have only experienced four ALP loan defaults and have yet to experience ALP loan charge offs, although it is unrealistic to expect zero charge offs to continue. We do expect loss rates on ALP loans will be materially lower than those experienced in the SBA 7(a) program given healthier liquidity of ALP businesses and borrowers, substantially larger businesses within the ALP portfolio, and stronger ALP guarantors. We are also pleased to report, that in a difficult economic environment in which the market sees higher levels of loan loss provisions and non-performing loans, we continue to forecast that 2025 EPS will fall in a range of $2.10 - $2.50. Obviously, the last three weeks have changed the economic outlook for almost every company across the globe, in some case dramatically. We continue to believe that organizations with higher margins, lower efficiency ratios, adequate capital and appropriate loan loss reserves will be the winners when macro headwinds shift to tailwinds.”\nMr. Sloane concluded, “We are proud of our track record and believe we are a premier originator of business loans to independent business owners in all 50 states, using all forms of financings and deal structures to achieve our goals and those of our customers. Becoming a financial holding company and owning a nationally chartered bank has enabled us to diversify our funding sources, reduce our financing costs, and provide value to our investors and clients.”\n, Your Business Solutions Company\n is a financial holding company, which along with its bank and non-bank consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, “NewtekOne”), provides a wide range of business and financial solutions under the Newtek\n brand to independent business owners. Since 1999, NewtekOne has provided state-of-the-art, cost-efficient products and services and efficient business strategies to independent business owners across all 50 states to help them grow their sales, control their expenses, and reduce their risk.\nNewtekOne’s and its subsidiaries’ business and financial solutions include: banking (Newtek Bank, N.A.), Business Lending, SBA Lending Solutions, Electronic Payment Processing, Accounts Receivable Financing & Inventory Financing, Insurance Solutions and Payroll and Benefits Solutions.

This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions. \n \nThe growth in the coaxial cable market is driven by several factors, many of which are linked to technological developments and shifts in consumer behavior. One of the primary growth drivers is the expansion of the global telecommunications sector, particularly in developing regions where infrastructure is rapidly evolving to meet the demand for high-speed internet and digital television services.\nThe increasing use of hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) networks, which rely on coaxial cables for the final connection between the fiber backbone and consumers, has significantly contributed to market demand. These networks are critical for delivering the high bandwidth required by today's media-rich applications, including video streaming, online gaming, and UHD television, which are all pushing the limits of data transmission technology.\nMoreover, the rising importance of coaxial cables in data centers, smart buildings, and surveillance systems has further stimulated growth. As organizations invest in infrastructure that supports the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, and other connected technologies, the need for high-performance, EMI-resistant coaxial cables has surged. In sectors such as aerospace, defense, and healthcare, the demand for secure, uninterrupted communication solutions is paramount, driving continued reliance on coaxial cables due to their superior shielding and performance characteristics.\nFurthermore, evolving consumer behavior, with increasing reliance on bandwidth-intensive applications, has led to higher demand for robust communication networks that can handle large data volumes with minimal latency. This intersection of technology advancements, infrastructure expansion, and shifting consumer habits continues to fuel the global growth of the coaxial cable market.\nThe report analyzes the Coaxial Cables market, presented in terms of units.

As part of this strategic expansion, Fixated has also added Jeff Shaivitz and Tim Mulligan to lead key functions within its growing Brand Partnerships division.\nThe acquisitions mark another major milestone for Fixated as it continues to unify a fragmented digital entertainment space, combining talent, content, gaming, and monetization into a single ecosystem built for creators.\nFounded by Cam Partridge, Camp Talent has carved out a distinctive presence in creator management, representing a roster that includes Jason Nash, Theo Wisseh, Nia Hill, Ben Methvin, bogey2putt, Heath Hussar, Becca Farsace, and Aspencoldfr.. Partridge will join Fixated’s team to continue building the careers of his creators within Fixated’s broader infrastructure.\nMoondust Management, founded by Kamla Pande, brings another influential slate of creators into Fixated’s management arm. With a roster spanning travel, lifestyle, wellness, and purpose-driven content, Moondust represents standout names like Catarina Mello, Lee Asher (@theasherhouse), Lindsay Stevens, Kaelyn Gutierrez, Kiersten Rich (@theblondeabroad), Harjit & Jaz (@YouTwoTV), and Jeff Jenkins (@chubbydiaries), among others. These creators not only command massive followings across platforms, but also bring a deep sense of community, advocacy, and aspirational storytelling to their work. Pande joins Fixated with a proven ability to nurture talent across verticals while building brands that resonate far beyond the feed.\n“At Fixated, we’re building the infrastructure that creators deserve,” said Jason Wilhelm, Co-Founder and President of Fixated. “That means surrounding them with experts, resources, and partnerships that allow them to scale their platforms into full-fledged businesses. Cameron and Kamla have built respected, high-integrity firms with real cultural impact. We’re thrilled to welcome them and their creators into the Fixated family.”\nFixated is also strengthening its Brand Partnerships team with the additions of Jeff Shaivitz and Tim Mulligan, two seasoned executives with a track record of building game-changing brand platforms in digital media. Shaivitz, who brings over 20 years of experience in the digital space—including roles at BENlabs, Studio71, Fullscreen, Machinima, and CollegeHumor—offers deep expertise in branded content and AI-powered marketing strategy and will lead the department as Fixated’s Senior Vice President of Business Development and Brand Partnerships. Mulligan, whose past roles include senior leadership at Cloud9, 100 Thieves, and XSET, joins with a reputation for closing transformative deals and scaling revenue across gaming and media. Together, they reinforce Fixated’s ambition to create a world-class brand ecosystem around its creators—one that’s innovative, scalable, and built for long-term cultural relevance.\n“Fixated isn’t just a management company—it’s a launchpad for creators to build generational businesses,” said Ali Adab, Chief Operations Officer and Partner at Fixated. “With the additions of Camp, Moondust, and two incredible brand leaders in Jeff and Tim, we’re doubling down on our commitment to help creators grow beyond the platforms and into every corner of the digital economy.”\nSince its launch in mid-2023, Fixated has quickly become a powerhouse in creator representation and content production, with a roster that includes Sketch, The Botez Sisters, Zach Justice & Dropouts, Funny Mike, Jimmy Zhang, and more. The company has also developed chart-topping games across Roblox and Fortnite and produced hit shows on YouTube and Snapchat.\n“These acquisitions aren’t about volume—they’re about vision,” said Zach Katz, Co-Founder and CEO of Fixated. “We’re identifying the right creators, the right managers, and the right partners to build something that goes beyond trends. Fixated is creating an ecosystem where cultural impact meets real commercial value.”\nThe announcement comes on the heels of Fixated’s $12.8 million investment from Eldridge Industries, and sets the stage for more announcements in the coming weeks as the company continues to scale its talent, content, and brand offerings.\nFixated is a next-generation digital content studio and talent representation powerhouse uniquely designed for creators seeking to unlock their full potential.

Please reach out via \n to set up a meeting or request a copy of the presentation.\nArtax Biopharma is a clinical-stage biotechnology company transforming the treatment of T Cell-driven autoimmune diseases. Artax’s first-in-class oral small molecules aim to deliver immune system modulation without immunosuppression, potentially unlocking new treatment options as both monotherapy and in combination with other treatments. Artax Biopharma is based in the Boston area and raised funding from investors including Advent Life Sciences, Sound Bioventures, The Termeer Family Office, the Fuhrer Family Office and Columbus Venture Partners. For more info, see \n or follow us on \n. \nWe believe there is significant potential for Nck modulation to revolutionize treatment of T Cell-driven diseases. Immunomodulation maintains healthy control of the immune system, while addressing the underlying source of T Cell-driven diseases. Central to a well-functioning immune system is the T Cell Receptor (TCR). When TCR signaling becomes dysregulated, it causes T Cell-driven conditions, including autoimmune diseases. We believe the immunomodulation mechanism offered by our investigational agents holds broad potential to revolutionize how these T Cell-driven autoimmune diseases are addressed, while not impairing the ability of a patient’s immune system to function properly.  \nAX-158, our lead Nck modulator, has shown strong, broad cytokine modulation as well as modulation of mixed lymphocyte reactions. Good data on therapeutic efficacy with AX-158 were observed in murine models of self-antigen activation (EAE), with a prolonged pharmacodynamic effect in EAE, suggesting durable immune modulation. AX-158 showed no immunosuppression in models of strong antigen stimulation. Studies with AX-158 showed substantial preclinical evidence of activity in the Th\n, Th\n, Th\n/Th\n pathways, suggesting that applications could be quite broad across the autoimmune space. \nFor future clinical study inquiries: \nMaria Nichol, DPhil, EPA, CPA\nChief Business Officer\nMadelin Hawtin\nLifeSci Communications", "article_contacts": null, "company_name": null, "company_website": null, "tags": [], "url": "https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/23/3066687/0/en/Artax-Biopharma-to-present-Phase-2a-data-on-Nck-modulator-AX-158-establishing-novel-mechanism-of-action-in-autoimmune-disease-at-the-2025-SID-Annual-Meeting.html"},
