This church requires all members to pass a graduation exam (about 100 questions) after completing elementary, intermediate, and advanced biblical education through the Zion Christian Mission Center before becoming a member. Shincheonji has famously held graduation ceremonies with over 100,000 students on four separate occasions.\nChairman \n, during his nationwide church visits, often cites Revelation 22:18–19, emphasizing, \"One must not add to or take away from Revelation; those who do will not enter heaven.\" He encourages believers to write Revelation on their hearts and minds.\nFollowing this message, Shincheonji's Education Department has been administering the \"Seal of God Confirmation Test\" to all members worldwide to qualify them for entry into heaven. This exam began online during the COVID-19 pandemic and is now conducted in person at local churches. The goal is for every member to become a \"walking Bible.\"\nAccording to a church representative, the only way to understand the true meaning and fulfillment of Revelation is through testimony from someone who saw and heard the actual events of Revelation come to life. They claim that since most Christian leaders and believers have neither seen nor heard the fulfillment, they have all altered Revelation—violating the scripture. \"Aside from Shincheonji believers, not one person in the global Christian community has kept Revelation intact,\" the representative stated.\nThey continued, \"While Shincheonji is labeled heretical by Catholic and Protestant churches, we are the only group whose members understand Revelation fully. The mainstream churches, including pastors and members, have distorted it. So who is truly orthodox, and who is truly heretical? Let the Bible decide.\"\nThe weekly exam covers the four Gospels and the entire Book of Revelation. Shincheonji considers it a training to engrave God's word in the heart and to uphold the New Covenant.\nFrom January to April of this year, the average score for the test was 99 points, with a participation rate of 97%, and 99.9% of participants scoring over 90 points. This reflects the high level of dedication and spiritual awareness among members.\nA Shincheonji representative added, \"Many Christians today don't know or care about the prophecies in the Gospels or Revelation, yet still call Shincheonji heretical. When asked to explain why from a biblical perspective, they have no answer—just like during Jesus' first coming.\"\nSome former pastors who have joined Shincheonji testify, \"This is the only church that teaches and practices the Bible correctly.\" One former pastor stated, \"Shincheonji teaches the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, so the members often know more than I did as a pastor. I've had to unlearn and start my faith over.\"\nAnother, Pastor Choi, said, \"Although I used to teach the Bible, coming to Shincheonji showed me how little I really knew. Churches should let their congregations hear the teachings of Shincheonji for themselves before judging.\" He added, \"It's negligence not to teach the Bible properly. Christian leaders should listen to these messages so everyone can learn God's final work.\"\nThe representative concluded, \"Just as a thirsty person searches for water, believers seeking truth are gathering where God's word is taught. Now is the time for believers around the world to discern truth from falsehood through the New Testament and the Book of Revelation.\"\n, Shincheonji Church of Jesus, 1 626-230-5039, ", "article_contacts": ", shincheonji.kr", "article_urls": ["/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f98a9a93979c8e8a9598b99e94989095d79a9694"], "url": "https://www.prweb.com/releases/shincheonji-church-of-jesus-the-only-church-in-the-world-where-all-believers-fully-understand-revelation-302438665.html"},

The law prevents new wells and disallows routine maintenance on existing facilities, undermining \n energy independence, endangering thousands of local jobs, harming national security, raising gasoline prices, and jeopardizing the economic stability of communities that rely on in-state oil production.\nThe filing comes on the heels of a similar suit filed last week by mineral and royalty owners against the law, group officials said.\n\"Californians deserve to have access to energy that is produced safely and responsibly within our state, rather than increasing our reliance on imported oil,\" said Rock Zierman, President of NOPEC. \"SB 1137 intends to shut down \n oil and gas industry, although Californians use more than 1.8 million barrels of oil a day. A decrease in in-state oil production has contributed to recent news that two more \n refineries are slated to close next year. Since imported crude costs \n-\n more per barrel than in-state crude, SB 1137 also contributes to higher gasoline prices in \n.\"\nSB 1137 circumvented the legislative process as it was introduced and passed just five days before the end of the 2022 legislative session. There were no substantive committee hearings, expert testimonies, or scientific data analysis. Energy industry members and the scientific community were not allowed to ask questions, refute anti-oil activist claims, or offer real scientific evidence. The state relied upon the much-discredited Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) report that compiled numerous studies that had nothing to do with \n oil production and established no causation link between production facilities and environmental harms.\nNOPEC and other opponents of the energy shutdown are pursuing a legal path to demonstrate that SB 1137, and any future legislation and law of its kind, is not legally sound. SB 1137 shuts down duly permitted operations that have mitigated all environmental impacts through adherence to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), according to the suit.\n operators also produce the only \n climate-compliant crude by being subject to the state's cap and trade climate program, officials said. Foreign oil imports are completely exempt from all of \n environmental rules and regulations.\n\"\n oil and gas industry is held to the most stringent environmental standards, with more than 20 state and federal agencies overseeing oil and gas production,\" said \n, Manager of Regulatory, Community, & Government Affairs at The Termo Company, an independent \n-based oil and gas exploration and production company. \"In the end, SB 1137 will severely impact small royalty owners and mineral owners while producers will be all but shut down. This puts 55,000 jobs in the oil and gas sector at risk, leading to higher gas prices and an economic blow to \n.\"\nNOPEC's lawsuit seeks to demonstrate that the law under SB 1137, constitutes an illegal taking under Article 5 of the US Constitution. The law shuts down in-state production sites, duly permitted assets into which companies have invested millions of dollars, without any proven environmental harm. It also violates due process and equal protection, given that entities with much higher proven emissions that exist in the setback zones, such as landfills, ports, water treatment facilities, and other industrial sites, are not shut down by this or any other law. Instead of relying on unfounded claims, the state must prove its case in a court of law, where statements must be factual and supported by scientific evidence.\n\"\n lack of credible scientific backing and disregard for local energy requirements are the driving forces behind our legal challenge. We firmly believe this law constitutes an illegal taking under the U.S. Constitution and undermines the principles of due process and equal protection,\" stated \n, CEO, RMX Resources LLC and Matrix Oil Corporation. \"We must safeguard \n economic stability to ensure an affordable and dependable supply of climate-compliant oil to fulfill the needs of all Californians.\"\nNOPEC remains committed to defending the interests of \n energy industry while advocating for the rights of its members and the broader community.\nNOPEC is a \n mutual benefit 501c(6) corporation which represents producer-operator entities as well as entities and individuals working in and around the oil and gas production industry.

The results show that this investigational drug demonstrates activity in anti-PD1-resistant lung cancer and that targeting adenosine may enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy for some lung cancers.\n, \n /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are often treated with immunotherapy drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to strengthen the immune system's ability to kill cancer cells — but these drugs do not produce a lasting response in most patients with this cancer type. Initial results of a phase 1 clinical trial of the investigational drug JNJ-86974680 reveal that it has the potential to overcome that limitation.\n, Assistant Professor of Oncology, Department of Medicine at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, will share initial results of the study Tuesday during the 2025 annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in \n. Dr. Jain is the presenting and first author of abstract CT137, \"Initial results from a phase 1 study of an A2a receptor antagonist, administered as monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD1 therapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer,\" to be presented \n, from \n, in Section 48, board 3 as part of the poster session First-in-Human Phase 1 Clinical Trials 2.\n\"While immunotherapy has transformed the treatment landscape for non-small cell lung cancer, most patients do not achieve durable responses to checkpoint inhibitors,\" notes Dr. Jain. \"These results from our early-phase clinical trial of the investigational drug JNJ-86974680 suggest that targeting the adenosine pathway — a major driver of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment — may offer a promising new strategy for improving outcomes with immunotherapy in this disease.\"\nThe multicenter phase 1 study (NCT06116786) evaluates JNJ-86974680, a small-molecule A2a receptor antagonist developed by Johnson & Johnson. The drug is designed to block adenosine-mediated immunosuppression by inhibiting A2a receptors on immune cells, potentially restoring T-cell activity against tumors.\nIn part 1 of the study, which assessed safety and dose-finding, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed when JNJ-86974680 was administered alone or in combination with cetrelimab, an investigational PD-1 inhibitor. Among 41 patients with advanced NSCLC who had progressed on prior anti-PD-1 therapy, stable disease was the best overall response, with one patient remaining on treatment for more than eight months.\n\"Importantly,\" notes Dr. Jain, \"JNJ-86974680 demonstrated near-complete blockade of A2a receptors on circulating immune cells — a pharmacodynamic effect that may further improve as the optimal tumor-penetrating dose is determined.\"\nPart 2 of the trial also includes radiation to metastatic lesions, combining JNJ-86974680, cetrelimab and radiation therapy to explore whether adenosine blockade can further sensitize tumors to immunotherapy — including in patients who have not previously received immunotherapy.\nThe team found that JNJ-86974680 almost completely blocked A2a receptors in immune cells circulating in the blood. They hope that effect will increase as they determine the optimal dose and the drug concentrates inside the tumor.\nIn addition to Roswell Park, the study team includes investigators from Johnson & Johnson and other leading institutions in \n, \n, \n and \n. \n, MD, of \n Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center served as senior author of the study.\nThe ongoing study, which is sponsored by Johnson & Johnson, is open for accrual at Roswell Park and other sites.

In the future, immune resilience might even be routinely assessed, much like cholesterol is today.\n\"Individuals with TCF7-linked immune resilience appear better equipped to resist inflammatory stressors and maintain a low-inflammatory immune profile promoting survival and better health,\" said \n, MD, professor of medicine at UT Health San Antonio and director of the Veterans Affairs Center for Personalized Medicine with the South Texas Veterans Health Care System in \n.\nAhuja led the multi-year, multi-disciplinary study titled, \"The 15-Year Survival Advantage: Immune Resilience as a Salutogenic Force in Healthy Aging,\" published \n in the journal Aging Cell.

Appropriately regulated inflammation is essential for protection against threats and supporting survival. However, inflammation is also linked to many diseases and mortality.\nThis may have contributed to the emergence of health-promoting salutogenic forces, including immune resilience, which could help mitigate the harmful effects of inflammation. The new study reveals that immune resilience is not fixed, but measurable and adaptable.\nAhuja's team identified the expression TCF7 as a key component of immune resilience. Higher TCF7 levels and related markers correlated with better health outcomes, improved resistance to disease and durable vaccine responses.\nThe \"pathogenic triad\": A balancing act\n\"Our work shows that immune resilience is associated with TCF7, a central master regulator that maintains T-cell health,\" said \n, MS, co-first author and senior research scientist at UT Health San Antonio.\nThe study proposes that TCF7-linked immune resilience may counterbalance what the authors term a \"pathogenic triad\" – inflammaging (chronic inflammation with aging), immune system aging and cell death or senescence.\nImmune resilience can diminish over time due to environmental threats (like infections or trauma) or internal stressors (such as myocardial ischemia). Analogous to a dam protecting a city from floods, immune resilience may act as a biological barrier, reducing the risk of the triad overwhelming the body.\n\"When salutogenesis declines and pathogenesis emerges, this may create a state of inflammation and immune aging that promotes disease,\" Ahuja said.\nThree immune resilience trajectories\nBy analyzing data from the 17,500 individuals, the team identified three immune resilience paths during inflammatory stress:\n\"Throughout life, inflammatory insults like infections may gradually reduce immune resilience,\" said \n, PharmD, PhD, co-first author and associate professor at The \n. \"Some individuals can preserve resilience longer than others.\"\nAging and immune resilience's \"warranty period\"\nThe study highlights three lifelong processes affecting health: salutogenesis, pathogenesis (drivers of disease) and senescence (aging). Declining immune resilience, potentially exacerbated by the triad, may raise susceptibility to age-related illnesses.\n\"Disease vulnerability differs from a vulnerability to lose health, which allows disease processes to emerge,\" said \n, MS, senior bioinformatician in the Veterans Health Center of Personalized Medicine. \"Aging and age-related diseases are distinct.\"\nHowever, even robust immune resilience has limits. Around age 70, the protective effects begin to wane – a threshold Manoharan terms \"failed salutogenesis.\"\nThe study found that participants in a large U.S. population with strong immune resilience at age 40 had a 15.5-year survival advantage over those with low resilience. Midlife (ages 40-70) is a pivotal window for longevity, with immune resilience reducing mortality by 69% during this period.\nBy age 70, however, longevity trajectories converged, eliminating this advantage.\n\"There's a biologically modifiable window of opportunity for interventions like diet, exercise or drugs,\" Lee said. \"Beyond this window, improving health span becomes more challenging.\"\nToward proactive health management\n, BS, a bioinformatician at the Center for Personalized Medicine, raises the possibility of routine immune resilience assessments someday. \"Optimal immune resilience is associated with a unique blood biomarker profile that reflects higher levels of growth and immune factors, along with lower levels of inflammation,\" he said.\nAnd Lee said that personalized plans based on immune resilience status could help prevent disease proactively.\nTCF7-linked immune resilience represents a novel, modifiable trait in aging research. Unlike traditional biomarkers tied to disease and inflammation, this immune program may enable personalized salutogenic interventions.\nEssentially, the Ahuja team's work shifts the focus from inevitable decline to optimizable resilience.

Panzura considers this an acknowledgement of the leadership role of Panzura CloudFS hybrid cloud file platform in the evolving landscape where hybrid cloud capabilities and artificial intelligence (AI) are converging to transform business operations.\nThe recognition comes as Gartner forecasts a significant surge in adoption, projecting that \"by 2028, 60% of I&O leaders will implement hybrid cloud file deployments, up from 25% recorded in early 2024.\" The projection aligns with findings from the 2024 Gartner Cloud and Hybrid Infrastructure Survey, cited in the guide, \"according to the survey, over half of the I&O leaders, precisely 63%, reported that their enterprises are actively managing hybrid cloud infrastructure.\" Technologists are recognizing the tangible benefits of proactive disaster recovery, enhanced performance, and superior availability – all critical tenets of modern data management strategies.\n\"In Panzura's view, the Gartner Market Guide provides validation of our vision for CloudFS, where data flows seamlessly from core to edge to cloud. In a world where every organization is becoming data centric, CloudFS drives true competitive advantage through cost optimization, ironclad resilience, and borderless data access,\" said \n, Head of Global Marketing, Panzura.\nSetting New Standards in Hybrid Cloud File Services\nOver the past year, Panzura has accelerated its innovation cadence, introducing groundbreaking capabilities within CloudFS 8.5 Adapt that further its ability to address critical market needs such as business continuity. According to the Gartner guide, \"hybrid cloud storage enhances business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities.\"\nThese advancements include:\nMeeting the Demands of Hybrid Cloud and AI\nThe Gartner Market Guide for Hybrid Cloud Storage notes, \"With the rise of generative AI deployments, the importance of long-term hybrid cloud services has increased proportionally to the growth in and volume of data at the edge.\"\nPanzura CloudFS addresses the growing importance of hybrid cloud storage in AI initiatives by enabling the rapid transfer of data from edge locations into a consolidated, deduplicated dataset accessible by LLMs. Data preparation for AI pipelines depends on seamless data availability and integration from various sources, whether on-premises or in the cloud, and CloudFS delivers access to the comprehensive datasets needed by technologists and data teams.\nThe CloudFS platform is also engineered to address the challenges of hybrid cloud integration, a top concern for I&O leaders seeking seamless data services across heterogeneous environments. The platform's deep integration with leading cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and others — while remaining storage agnostic — provides a unified and consistent file experience. It enables simultaneous co-authoring and collaboration with advanced features such as patented global deduplication and real-time file and byte-range locking.\nFurthermore, its immutable architecture and near real time ransomware detection provides an unassailable layer of defense against ransomware, exfiltration, and other data loss scenarios, directly addressing the escalating security threats faced by enterprises.\nThe Gartner Market Guide for Hybrid Cloud Storage asserts, \"Instead of one-way data movement, early adopters of hybrid cloud storage are using multidirectional synchronization of data between the edge, core data center and public cloud.\" From the Panzura perspective, CloudFS supports the modern enterprise need for multi-directional data flow.\nEnabling the Future of File Data Services\nThese technological advancements emphasize the proactive approach of CloudFS toward addressing the evolving demands of the hybrid cloud landscape. The company says this is reflective of Gartner's emphasis on solutions that offer value-added data services beyond mere storage.\nIn Panzura's view, for instance, CloudFS supports the industry transition where, according to Gartner, \"As migration to the cloud continues, I&O teams are transforming from providers of data center infrastructure to providers of data management services everywhere.\"\nThe platform delivers the necessary file data infrastructure that supports data availability, scalability, performance, security, and cost-efficiency. This includes critical areas cited by the Gartner Market Guide like cyber resilience, lifecycle management, and seamless data mobility.

During Crete's remarks, attendees, including Senator \n (D-CT), sat in stunned silence. Several were moved to tears.\nCrete is Chairman of The Invisible Enemy, a non-profit foundation that represents military personnel who were exposed to dangerous radiation and toxic substances while serving on the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR). From 1951 to1992, more than 1,000 nuclear detonations took place on the NTTR. Crete was stationed there from 1983 to 1987.\n\"In 1975, the federal government did an environmental assessment of where I worked,\" Crete said in the hearing. \"They said nobody should be there. They said if somebody does go there, they should only be allowed limited access to limit exposure. In 1979, they built my base. They said the benefit to national security outweighed the future environmental liabilities.\n\"In our service, we never knew what we were being exposed to,\" Crete continued. \"Our commanders didn't know. My dormitory was 2.3 miles from a nuclear test. The front gate of my base was 5 miles away from a nuclear test. Our soil was contaminated. The water that my food was cooked in was contaminated. The water that I showered in every day was contaminated.\"\nYears later, Crete began to reconnect with members of his unit and discovered many of them suffered from serious medical conditions, including tumors.\n\"I had one the size of a grapefruit removed from my back,\" Crete revealed. \"There's about 20 more around my body. I have a brain cyst. I have brain atrophy. The left side of my brain is shrinking and dying. I'm one of the healthy ones.\n\"Worse,\" he added, choking back tears. \"Worse is the fact that my wife had three miscarriages. All four of my children were born with birth defects or significant health problems. One was corrected surgically. The other three will never be corrected. And they live with it. It's not their fault. I'm not saying it's mine, but I brought it home. It was my DNA that was permanently altered from low-dose, long-term ionizing radiation exposure.\"\nOnce Crete founded The Invisible Enemy he heard from hundreds of NTTR veterans facing similar hardships. Like Crete, the Veterans Administration (VA) denied them critical healthcare and benefits that were granted to other veterans who were exposed at other contaminated sites, benefits that could have saved lives. To date, the foundation knows of 463 NTTR veterans who have died.\n\"The Department of Energy, in 2000, was able to have a bill signed by President Clinton called the EEOICPA (Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act),\" Crete explained. \"That bill took care of the person who cooked my cheeseburger at my chow hall, but refuses to take care of me, the guy who ate it. Just think about that.\"\nThe reason NTTR veterans continue to be ignored is because, according to the Department of Defense (DoD), they never served there. Due to their highly classified missions, the DoD categorically denies they even exist. There are no records to prove to the VA that NTTR veterans actually are veterans who were injured in the line of duty and, therefore, are eligible for the same care and benefits all other veterans receive.\nThe Invisible Enemy is working with members of Congress to pass legislation to right this wrong. Representative \n (R-NV) has introduced H.R. 1400 that forces the federal government to acknowledge NTTR veterans and their injuries, and provide the comprehensive healthcare they need and the just financial compensation they deserve.\nCrete and others are actively promoting the bill to congressional staff, and lining-up bi-partisan support and co-sponsors in the House and Senate.\n\"I am asking that Congress please allow us to get the benefits that every other veteran has earned,\" Crete said, concluding his testimony. \"We're not asking to be special. We're asking to be equal.\"\n###\nAbout The Invisible Enemy Foundation\nOur mission is to enact legislation that guarantees comprehensive medical treatment and just financial compensation for military personnel and their families who were exposed to environmental contamination while working at the Nevada Test & Training Range (NTTR).\nU.S. Representative \n of \n is leading an initiative to write new federal legislation that guarantees medical treatment and financial compensation to all military personnel who suffered illnesses from exposure to toxic radiation and materials released by nuclear testing on the NTTR.\nDue the highly sensitive, top-secret classification of their deployments, the federal government has refused to be held accountable, claiming those personnel \"were never there.\" As a result, most of the military personnel who served on the NTTR, and their families, have been unjustly and deliberately denied these benefits. The goal of our mission is to right this wrong.\nThe Invisible Enemy Foundation is a registered 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization,\nEIN # 92-3486613.

The new approach will employ a range of testing methods, including computational models of toxicity and cell lines using artificial intelligence (AI) and organoid testing in laboratory settings with MPS, also known as organ on a chip. The FDA collectively refers to these as New Approach Methodologies (NAMs).\nIn addition to reducing animal experimentation, the FDA aims to lower research and development (R&D) costs, and ultimately, drug prices, while ensuring safer therapies reach patients faster.\n, Draper's Biodefense/Accelerating MCM Development portfolio lead said, \"Draper is aligned with the FDA's decision to reduce its dependence on animal testing and to utilize the results and insights that NAMs can deliver in the drug testing and evaluation process. With over 20 years of experience developing MPS-based solutions and advanced models for biodefense applications, we fully understand the role in vitro human tissue testing and data intelligence will have when evaluating the safety and effectiveness of drugs, vaccines and antibody-based treatments. And, as a non-profit engineering innovation company, Draper is uniquely positioned to work at the intersection of government, industry and academia to move this initiative forward.\"\n\"The FDA's roadmap creates an important opportunity to expand the role of microphysiological systems and related technologies,\" said \n, Laboratory Fellow at Draper. \"Organ models have been around for a while, but their role has been limited to essentially research devices that are incompatible with the pharmaceutical workflow. We at Draper are developing systems that are designed to integrate seamlessly into the drug development workflow, and we have demonstrated in vitro in vivo correlation across a range of high impact applications in disease modeling and safety science. The time for MPS is now, and we are uniquely positioned to meet this moment.\"\nDraper innovations in the MPS space have resulted in a class-leading, high-throughput, tunable organ-on-chip (OOC) microenvironment that can generate physiologically relevant responses in human organ tissue models to accelerate drug discovery, toxicity screening and efficacy testing for therapeutics and vaccines. Draper's flagship MPS architecture – PREDICT96 – has an instrumented microfluidic culture plate (MCP) in the standard 384-well plate footprint that supports 96 individual OOCs or arrayed multi-organ systems simultaneously, with sensors to monitor individual OOCs.\nDraper began its MPS development in the early 2000s to improve the understanding of how chemical, biological, radiation and nuclear (CBRN) threats affect the human body and to predict the safety and effectiveness of drugs, vaccines, and antibody-based treatments. Draper advancements in the field have resulted in solutions that leverage human tissue platforms (MPS), immune system models, molecular and cellular assays, omics-based technologies, and advanced analytical methods. These innovations enable in-depth assessment of threat agents and medical countermeasure (MCM) interventions.\nIn its 25-year history of MPS development, Draper has achieved multiple industry firsts: first to culture mammalian cells in a microfluidic device, first durable multi-organ system, first multiplex instrumented MPS, and first robust MPS in high containment.\nDraper has ongoing sponsored work with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) (ETHOS) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) (for COVID-CBRN and Filovirus research) that are aligned with FDA's long-term goals and objectives. Additionally, Draper maintains business relationships with world-renowned experts at the nation's leading universities, industry partners, the DoE National Labs, Federally Funded Research and Develop and Centers (FFRDCs), and Contract Research Organizations (CROs) to support FDA's long-term investments and objectives.\nDraper is committed to supporting MPS advancement through R&D and innovation, establishing best practices and data standardization, all geared toward accelerating MCM development and testing through a broad team of world-renowned experts. As a non-profit engineering innovation company, Draper is committed to participating in the workgroups and consortia outlined in the FDA's roadmap to reduce animal testing over the next five years.\nAbout Draper \nDraper is a non-profit research and development company that solves some of the nation's most important challenges.
